# Analysis of Categorical Data

We now consider applications of the very important chi-square statistic, first proposed by Karl Pearson in 1900.
So we can get some idea as to why Pearson first proposed his chi-square statistic, we begin with the Binomial case. That is, let $Y_{1}$ be $\operatorname{Bin}\left(n, p_{1}\right)$, where $0<p<1$. According to the Central Limit Theorem,

$$
Z=\frac{Y_{1}-n p_{1}}{\sqrt{n p_{1}\left(1-p_{1}\right)}}
$$

has a distribution that is approximately $N(0,1)$ for large $n$, particularly when $n p_{1} \geq 5$ and $n\left(1-p_{1}\right) \geq 5$.

Thus, it is not surprising that $Q_{1}=Z^{2}$ is approximately $\chi^{2}(1)$. If we let $Y_{2}=n-Y_{1}$ and $p_{2}=1-p_{1}$, we see that $Q_{1}$ may be written as

$$
Q_{1}=\frac{\left(Y_{1}-n p_{1}\right)^{2}}{n p_{1}\left(1-p_{1}\right)}=\frac{\left(Y_{1}-n p_{1}\right)^{2}}{n p_{1}}+\frac{\left(Y_{2}-n p_{2}\right)^{2}}{n p_{2}}
$$

or

$$
Q_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{2} \frac{\left(Y_{i}-n p_{i}\right)^{2}}{n p_{i}}
$$

To generalize, we let an experiment have $k$ (instead of only two) mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes, say, $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{k}$. Let $p_{i}=P\left(A_{i}\right)$, and thus $\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_{i}=1$. The experiment is repeated $n$ independent times, and we let $Y_{i}$ represent the number of times the experiment results in $A_{i}, i=1,2, \ldots, k$. This joint distribution of $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \ldots, Y_{k-1}$ is a generalization of the Binomial distribution.

The joint pmf of $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \ldots, Y_{k-1}$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \qquad f\left(y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{k-1}\right)=\frac{n!}{y_{1}!y_{2}!\cdots y_{k}!} p_{1}^{y_{1}} p_{2}^{y_{2}} \cdots p_{k}^{y_{k}}, \text{ for: } y_{1} \geq 0, y_{2} \geq 0, \cdots, y_{k-1} \geq 0;\\
& \text{ and } y_{1}+y_{2}+\ldots+y_{k-1} \leq n . \\
\end{aligned}
$$
We say that $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \ldots, Y_{k-1}$ have a multinomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots, p_{k-1}.$

Pearson then extended $Q_{1}$ to an expression that we denote by $Q_{k-1}$,

$$
Q_{k-1}=\sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{\left(Y_{i}-n p_{i}\right)^{2}}{n p_{i}}
$$

He argued that $Q_{k-1}$ has an approximate chi-square distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom in a similar way we argued that $Q_{1}$ is approximately $\chi^{2}(1)$.

## Multinomial Response Model

- When a categorical (qualitative) variable of interest results in one of two responses ( $k=2$ ) (e.g., "Yes" or "No" to had epidural to reduce pain during child birth, "Yes" or "No" still breastfeeding at six months) the data ? called counts ? can be analyzed with a Binomial probability distribution.
- Categorical data with more than two levels (classes, categories) often result from a multinomial model.
- Binomial model is a multinomial model with $k=2$.


**Properties of the Multinomial Model**

1. The are $n$ identical trials.
2. There are k (or: $r \times c$ " r for number of rows" and " c for number of columns") possible outcomes to each trial. These outcomes are sometimes called classes, categories, or cells.
3. The probabilities of the $k$ outcomes, denoted by $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, \ldots, p_{k}$, where $p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}+\ldots+p_{k}=1$, remain the same from trial to trial.
4. The trials are independent.
5. The random variables of interest are the cell counts $n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots, n_{k}$ of the number of observations that fall into each of the $k$ categories.


::::: example
Suppose that customers can purchase one of the three brands of milk at a supermarket. In a study to determine whether one brand is preferred over another, a record is made of a sample of $n=300$ milk purchases. The data are shown below. Do the data provide sufficient evidence to indicate a preference for one or more brands?

<div style="text-align: center">

**Table 18.1: Table of Example 18.1**

| Brand 1 | Brand 2 | Brand 3 | Total |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 100 | 100 | 100 | 300 |

</div>


**Step 1. State Hypotheses.**

If all the brands are equally preferred, then the probability that a purchaser will choose any one brand is the same as the probability of choosing any other - that is, $p_{1}=p_{2}=p_{3}=1 / 3$. Therefore, the null hypothesis of "no preference" is

$$
H_{0}: p_{1}=p_{2}=p_{3}=1 / 3
$$

If $p_{1}, p_{2}$, and $p_{3}$ are not all equal, the brands are not equally preferred; in other words, the purchasers must have a preference for one (or possibly) two brands. The alternative hypothesis is

$$
H_{a}: p_{1}, p_{2}, \text { and } p_{3} \text { are not all equal }
$$

Therefore, we seek a test statistic that will detect a lack of fit of the observed cell counts to our hypothesized (null) expected cell counts based on the hypothesized cell probabilities.
These expected values are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& E\left(n_{1}\right)=n p_{1}=(300)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)=100 \\
& E\left(n_{2}\right)=n p_{2}=(300)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)=100 \\
& E\left(n_{3}\right)=n p_{3}=(300)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)=100
\end{aligned}
$$

**Step 2. Computing test statistic. **

<div style="text-align: center">

**Table 18.2: Table of Expected Counts**

| Brand 1 | Brand 2 | Brand 3 | Total |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 100 | 100 | 100 | 300 |

</div>

The test statistic for comparing the observed and expected cell counts (and, consequently, testing $H_{0}: p_{1}=p_{2}=p_{3}=1 / 3$ is the $\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{2}}$ statistic:

$$
\begin{align}
\chi^{2} &=\sum_{\text {all cells }} \frac{(\text { observed }- \text { expected })^{2}}{\text { expected }}\\
  & =\sum_{\text {all cells }} \frac{\left(n_{i}-E\left(n_{i}\right)\right)^{2}}{E\left(n_{i}\right)} \\
  &=\frac{(78-100)^{2}}{100}+\frac{(117-100)^{2}}{100}+\frac{(105-100)^{2}}{100} \\
  &=4.84+2.89+0.25=7.98
\end{align}
$$

**Step 3. Finding P-value.**

To find the P -value, compare $X^{2}$ with critical values from the chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom one fewer than the number of values the brand can take. That's $3-1=2$ degrees of freedom. From Table D, we see that $X^{2}=7.98$ falls between 0.02 and 0.01 critical values of the chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. So the P -value of $X^{2}=7.98$ is between 0.01 and 0.02 ( $0.01<P-$ value $<0.02$ ).

**Step 4. Conclusion. **

If we used $\alpha=0.05$, since our $P-$ value $<\alpha=0.05$, we could reject $H_{0}$ at the $5 \%$ significance level. We would conclude that the three brands of milk are not equally preferred.

::::: 

::::: example

Raymond Weil is about to come out with a new watch and wants to find out whether people have special preferences of the color of the watchband, or whether all four colors under consideration are equally preferred. A random sample of 80 prospective watch buyers is selected. Each person is shown the watch with four different band colors and asked to state his or her preference. The results (observed counts) are given below.

<div style="text-align: center">

**Table 18.3: Table of Example 18.2**

| Tan | Brown | Maroon | Black | Total |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 12 | 40 | 8 | 20 | 80 |

</div>

Use $\alpha=0.01$.

**Step 1. State Hypotheses.**

If all the brands are equally preferred, then the probability that a purchaser will choose any one color is the same as the probability of choosing any other - that is, $p_{1}=p_{2}=p_{3}=p_{4}=1 / 4$. Therefore, the null hypothesis of "no preference" is

$$
H_{0}: p_{1}=p_{2}=p_{3}=p_{4}=1 / 4
$$

If $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}$ and $p_{4}$ are not all equal, the colors are not equally preferred. The alternative hypothesis is

$$
H_{a}: p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3} \text { and } p_{4} \text { are not all equal }
$$

Therefore, we seek a test statistic that will detect a lack of fit of the observed cell counts to our hypothesized (null) expected cell counts based on the hypothesized cell probabilities.
These expected values are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& E\left(n_{1}\right)=n p_{1}=(80)\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)=20 \\
& E\left(n_{2}\right)=n p_{2}=(80)\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)=20 \\
& E\left(n_{3}\right)=n p_{3}=(80)\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)=20 \\
& E\left(n_{4}\right)=n p_{4}=(80)\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)=20
\end{aligned}
$$

<div style="text-align: center">

**Table 18.4: Table of Expected Counts**

| Tan | Brown | Maroon | Black | Total |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 20  | 20   | 20     | 20   | 80   |

</div>

**Step 2. Computing test statistic.**

The test statistic for comparing the observed and expected cell counts (and, consequently, testing $H_{0}: p_{1}=p_{2}=p_{3}=p_{4}=1 / 4$ is the $\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{2}}$ statistic:


\begin{aligned}
  \chi^{2} &=\sum_{\text {all cells }} \frac{(\text { observed }- \text { expected })^{2}}{\text { expected }} \\
           &= \sum_{\text {all cells }} \frac{\left(n_{i}-E\left(n_{i}\right)\right)^{2}}{E\left(n_{i}\right)} \\
           &= \frac{(12-20)^{2}}{20}+\frac{(40-20)^{2}}{20}+\frac{(8-20)^{2}}{20}+\frac{(2-20)^{2}}{20} \\
           &= 64 / 20+400 / 20+144 / 20+0=30.4
\end{aligned}


**Step 3. Finding P-value.**

To find the P -value, compare $X^{2}$ with critical values from the chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom one fewer than the number of values the color can take. That's $4-1=3$ degrees of freedom. From Table D , we see that $X^{2}=30.4$ is greater than the greatest entry in the $\mathrm{df}=3$ row, which is the critical value for tail area 0.0005 . The P -value is therefore smaller than 0.0005 .

**Step 4. Conclusion.**

Since our $P$ - value $<\alpha=0.01$, we conclude that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis that all four colors are equally likely to be chosen. Some colors are probably preferable to others. Our P-value is very small.

```
x = c(12, 40, 8, 20);
chisq.test(x);
# chisq.test(x) gives you test statistic;
# degrees of freedom and P-value;
chisq.test(x)$expected;
# gives you expected counts;
```

```

::::: exercise

Consider a multinomial experiment involving $n=150$ trials and $k=5$ cells. The observed frequencies resulting from the experiment are shown in the accompanying table, and the null hypothesis to be tested is as follows:

$$
H_{0}: p_{1}=0.1, p_{2}=0.2, p_{3}=0.3, p_{4}=0.2, p_{5}=0.2
$$

Test the hypothesis at the $1 \%$ significance level.

& E\left(n_{4}\right)=n p_{4}=(150)\left(\frac{2}{10}\right)=30 \\

        &=9 / 15+4 / 30+9 / 45+36 / 30+4 / 30=2.2667
\end{aligned}


**Step 3. Finding P-value.**

To find the P -value, compare $X^{2}$ with critical values from the chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom one fewer than the number of "columns". That's $5-1=4$ degrees of freedom. From Table D, we see that $X^{2}=2.2667$ is smaller than the smallest entry (5.39) in the $\mathrm{df}=4$ row, which is the critical value for tail area 0.25 . The P -value is therefore greater than 0.25 .

**Step 4. Conclusion.**

Since our $P-$ value $>0.25>\alpha=0.01$, we conclude that there is NOT enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis $H_{0}$. There is not enough evidence to infer that at least one $p_{i}$ is not equal to its specified value.

:::::

## The Chi-square Test for Goodness of fit

A categorical variable has $k$ possible outcomes, with probabilities $p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots, p_{k}$. That is , $p_{i}$ is the probability of the $i$ th outcome. We have $n$ independent observations from this categorical variable. To test the null hypothesis that the probabilities have specified values


\begin{aligned}
H_{0}:& \, p_{1} = p_{hyp_1}, \, 
           p_{2} = p_{hyp_2}, \,
           \ldots, \,
           p_{k} = p_{hyp_k}   \\

H_{a}:& \, \text{at least one of } \, p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3} \, \text { is different }
\end{aligned}


Use the chi-square statistic

$$
\chi^{2}=\sum \frac{(\text { observed count }- \text { expected count })^{2}}{\text { expected count }}
$$

(expected counts are equal to $n p_{i}$ ).
The P -value is the area to the right of $X^{2}$ under the density curve of the chi-square distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom.

## Sample Size Assumption

We must have enough data for the methods to work. We usually check the following:
Expected Cell Frequency Condition: We should expect to see at least five individuals in each cell.
The expected cell frequency condition sounds like the condition that $n p$ and $n(1-p)$ be at least 10 when we tested proportions, it is similar to that.

**(a)** $E_i = np_i$ gives expected counts of $32.5, 35, 32.5, 60, 50, 40$ candies.

**(b)** The largest individual contribution comes from Brown (0.623), but every contribution here is small.

**(c)** $\chi^2 = \sum (O_i - E_i)^2/E_i \approx 1.7592$.

**(d)** $df = k - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5$, and the p-value $\approx 0.8814$.

**Interpretation:** Since the p-value (0.8814) is far greater than a typical significance level such as $\alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_0$. There is no evidence that the student's bag of candies departs from the company's claimed color distribution.

**Interpretation:** $\chi^2 \approx 6.667$ with $df = 3$, giving a p-value $\approx 0.0833$.

<div class="exercise-label">Question 6</div>
A city library wants to know whether book checkouts are evenly distributed across the seven days of the week. Over the course of a month, the librarian records which day of the week each book was checked out on, and plans to test $H_0: p_1 = p_2 = \cdots = p_7 = 1/7$ using a chi-square goodness-of-fit test.

(a) List the five properties that must hold for this to be a valid multinomial experiment.
(b) For each property, briefly state whether it plausibly holds in this library scenario, and explain any property you think might be questionable.
</div>

<details data-type="hint">
<summary>💡 Hint</summary>
<div class="content">
- The five properties concern: the number of trials, the number and structure of possible outcomes per trial, whether outcome probabilities stay constant, whether trials are independent of one another, and what the random variables of interest actually are.

</div>
</details>

<details data-type="answer">
<summary>✅ Answer</summary>
<div class="content">
**(a)** The five properties of a multinomial experiment are:

1. There is a fixed number of $n$ identical trials.
2. Each trial results in one of $k$ mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (here, $k = 7$ days).
3. The probability of each outcome, $p_1, \ldots, p_k$, remains constant from trial to trial.
4. The trials are independent of one another.
5. The random variables of interest are the cell counts $n_1, \ldots, n_k$ — the number of trials falling into each category.

**(b)** In this scenario, each "trial" is one book checkout, and $n$ is the total number of checkouts recorded over the month — this is fixed once the data are collected, satisfying property 1. Each checkout falls on exactly one day of the week, so the seven days form mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories, satisfying property 2. The cell counts (number of checkouts on each day) are indeed the variables of interest, satisfying property 5.

Property 3 (constant probabilities) is plausible if the library's weekly patterns are stable across the month, but could be questionable if, for example, a special event or holiday during the month temporarily changed typical borrowing patterns on a particular day.

Property 4 (independence) is the most questionable: if the same patron checks out multiple books in a single visit, or checks out books repeatedly on their usual visiting day throughout the month, those checkouts are not truly independent trials — a librarian assuming independence when patrons' repeated visits cluster on particular days could understate the true variability in the data.

- $H_0$ states that all four hypothesized proportions hold simultaneously; $H_a$ states that at least one of them is wrong — not that all of them are wrong.

**(a)**
$$H_0: p_{\text{Food}} = 0.40,\ p_{\text{Service}} = 0.30,\ p_{\text{Wait}} = 0.20,\ p_{\text{Clean}} = 0.10$$
$$H_a: \text{at least one category probability differs from its hypothesized value}$$

**(b)** $E_{\text{Food}} = 120(0.40) = 48$, $E_{\text{Service}} = 120(0.30) = 36$, $E_{\text{Wait}} = 120(0.20) = 24$, $E_{\text{Clean}} = 120(0.10) = 12$.

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(58-48)^2}{48} + \frac{(30-36)^2}{36} + \frac{(20-24)^2}{24} + \frac{(12-12)^2}{12} = 2.0833 + 1.0000 + 0.6667 + 0 = 3.75$$

**(d)** $df = k - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3$. Since $\chi^2 = 3.75 < 7.815 = \chi^2_{0.05,\,3}$, the test statistic does **not** fall in the rejection region. (Equivalently, the exact p-value is about $0.290$, which is greater than $0.05$.)

**(e)** Since $\chi^2 = 3.75$ does not exceed the critical value at $\alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_0$. There is not enough evidence to conclude that this restaurant's complaint categories differ from the chain's historical proportions.

- Expected counts are $E_i = np_i$, exactly as in any other goodness-of-fit setup — no test statistic is needed here.
- The expected-cell-frequency condition requires *every* category's expected count to be at least 5, not just most of them.
- If some categories fail the condition, think about what combining categories, or increasing $n$, would do to the expected counts.

<div class="content">
**(a)** $E_{\text{Fruit}} = 25(0.35) = 8.75$, $E_{\text{Chips}} = 25(0.30) = 7.5$, $E_{\text{Candy}} = 25(0.15) = 3.75$, $E_{\text{Nuts}} = 25(0.10) = 2.5$, $E_{\text{Other}} = 25(0.10) = 2.5$.

**(b)** The expected-cell-frequency condition requires every expected count to be at least 5. Here, Fruit (8.75) and Chips (7.5) satisfy this, but Candy (3.75), Nuts (2.5), and Other (2.5) do **not** — three of the five categories fall below 5. The condition does not hold for this sample.

**(c)** Because three categories have expected counts well below 5, the chi-square distribution is not a reliable approximation to the true sampling distribution of the test statistic at this sample size, so a chi-square goodness-of-fit test performed with $n = 25$ could produce a misleading p-value. The researcher should either substantially increase the sample size so that every expected count reaches at least 5 (for example, $n$ would need to be at least 50 to bring the Nuts and Other categories to an expected count of 5), or combine some of the smaller categories (e.g., merging Nuts and Other into a single "Other" category) so that the resulting expected counts satisfy the condition.

**(a)** Expected counts: $E_{\text{Search}} = 400(0.50) = 200$, $E_{\text{Social}} = 400(0.20) = 80$, $E_{\text{Direct}} = 400(0.20) = 80$, $E_{\text{Referral}} = 400(0.10) = 40$.

Chi-square contributions:
$$\frac{(180-200)^2}{200} = 2.00 \qquad \frac{(100-80)^2}{80} = 5.00 \qquad \frac{(70-80)^2}{80} = 1.25 \qquad \frac{(50-40)^2}{40} = 2.50$$

**(b)** Social media contributes the most (5.00). This means the Social media category's observed count (100) deviates from its expected count (80) by more, relative to the size of that expected count, than any other traffic source — it is the category driving the overall lack of fit the most.

**(c)** $\chi^2 = 2.00 + 5.00 + 1.25 + 2.50 = 10.75$, with $df = 4 - 1 = 3$. Since $\chi^2 = 10.75 > 7.815 = \chi^2_{0.05,\,3}$, the statistic falls in the rejection region. We reject $H_0$ at the 5% significance level: there is evidence that actual traffic-source proportions differ from the hypothesized 50/20/20/10 split, with Social media traffic in particular exceeding what was hypothesized.

**(a)** The **hypothesized probabilities** are $p_{\text{hyp}} = 0.45, 0.25, 0.20, 0.10$ — these come from the company's historical claim and are fixed before any data are collected. The **observed counts** are $90, 42, 30, 18$ — these are what the supervisor actually counted in the sample of 180 defective items.

$$df = k - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3$$

**(c)** Since $\chi^2 = 2.20$ does not exceed the critical value $\chi^2_{0.05,\,3} = 7.815$, we **fail to reject** $H_0$ at the 5% significance level.
