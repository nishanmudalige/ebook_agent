# Descriptive Statistics

## Representing Data

Data comes to us in the form of \textit{observations} (i.e. measurements) which we write symbolically as a lower case letter along with a subscript. For example, suppose we have taken a total of $n$ observations. We have observation 1, observation 2, observation 3, $\ldots$, observation $n-1$ and observation $n$. By letting $x$ represent an observation, all $n$ observations can be represented as:

$$x_1,~x_2,~ \ldots ,~ x_n$$ 

where $x_i$ is an individual observation, and the index $i=1, \ldots , n$. Here $n$ is referred to as the \textit{sample size}. We can also represent this data in condensed form as:

$$x_i:\ i=1, \ldots , n$$

or in tabular form as:

::: {#smalltbl .smalltbl}
| Index       | 1     | 2     | $\ldots$  | $n$   |
| :---------- | :-:   | :-:   | :-:       | :-:   |
| Observation | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $\ldots$  | $x_n$ |
:::



## Numerical Measures 

The most common numerical measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. These measures summarize a set of data by identifying the central point within that data.

The \textit{mean} (or more precisely the arithmetic mean) of a data set is obtained by adding up all of the observations and dividing by the sample size (number of observations). The mean is the typical average that we are all familiar with. 
We use the symbol $\bar{x}$ to represent the sample mean.


### Mean

::: {.definition name="Mean" #Mean}
Let $x_{1}, ~x_{2}, ~x_{3}, ~\ldots , ~x_{n}$ represent a sample of $n$ observations.
The sample mean is defined as:
	$$\bar{x} = \frac{ \displaystyle\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_{i} }{n} = \frac{ x_{1} + x_{2} + \dots + x _{n} }{n}$$
:::

### Median

::: {.definition name="Median" #Median}
The median is the middle value of a data set when the observations are arranged in ascending order.
:::

The calculation of the median depends on whether the sample size is odd or even.
If the sample size is odd, the median is the middle observation. If the sample size is even, the median is the average of the two middle observations.

Consider $n$ ordered observations $x_{(1)},x_{(2)},~\cdots~,x_{(n)}$.

- If $n$ is odd
    $$\text{Median} = \text{observation} \> \left( \frac{n + 1}{2} \right) $$
- If $n$ is even,
    $$\text{Median} = \text{average of observation} ~ \left(\frac{n}{2} \right) ~\text{and observation} ~ \left( \frac{n}{2} + 1 \right)$$
    
### Mode

::: {.definition name="Mode" #Mode}
The mode is the most frequently occurring observation in a data set.
:::

We are also interested in how the data is spread out or dispersed.
The most common numerical measures of the dispersion are the range, variance, and standard deviation. These measures summarize a set of data by identifying the spread or variability within that data.


### Variance

::: {.definition name="Variance" #Var}
The sample variance is the average squared deviation of each observation from the sample mean.

Let $x_{1}, ~x_{2}, ~x_{3}, ~\ldots , ~x_{n}$ represent a sample of $n$ observations.
The sample Variance is defined as:
	$$s^{2} = \frac{ \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2} }{n - 1}  = \frac{ (x_{1} - \bar{x})^{2} +  (x_{2} - \bar{x})^{2} + \ldots + (x_{n} - \bar{x})^{2} }{n-1}$$
where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean in Definition \@ref(def:Mean).
:::


In the Definition \@ref(def:Var), we divide by $n-1$ instead of $n$ since we are estimating the
value of the population variance using sample data, and this calculation already includes utilizing
the sample mean $\bar{x}$ which itself is an estimate of the population mean $\mu$. 
This division by $n-1$ is known as Bessel's correction.

Another reason for dividing by $n-1$ is because the sample variance is an unbiased estimator of the population variance, which is a topic covered in [STA260](https://utm.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/sta260h5) and beyond the scope of this course.

In the calculation of the sample variance, notice each term is squared, which means that the variance is always a non-negative number. 
When this occurs, the units of the variance are the square of the units of the original data.
To return to the original units, we take the square root of the variance to obtain the standard deviation.


### Standard Deviation

::: {.definition name="Standard Deviation" #StDev}
Let $x_{1}, x_{2}, ~x_{3}, ~\ldots , ~x_{n}$ represent a sample of $n$ observations.
The sample standard deviation is defined as:
$$s = + \sqrt{s^{2}}$$
where $s^{2}$ is the sample variance in Definition \@ref(def:Var).
:::


When we analyze data we typically describe the data in terms of the mean and standard deviation
as the units are the same. However, the calculation of the sample variance is an important
intermediate step.

One of the measures of central tendency and dispersion on their own will not give as a complete picture
of the data, however when analyzed collectively, we are able to get a better overall understanding of the data.


### Range

The range is the difference between the largest and smallest observations in a data set.

::: {.definition name="Range" #Range}
Let $x_{1}, ~x_{2}, ~x_{3}, ~\ldots , ~x_{n}$ represent a sample of $n$ observations.
The range is
$$\text{Range} = \max(x_{1}, x_{2}, ~x_{3}, ~\ldots , ~x_{n}) - \min(x_{1}, x_{2}, ~x_{3}, ~\ldots , ~x_{n}) $$
:::

### Percentiles

::: {.definition name="Percentile" #Percentile}
In an ordered data set, the $p^{th}$ percentile is the value such that $p\%$ of all observations lie below it.
:::

Percentiles are a value that are relative to the rest of the data.

::: {.example}
A class writes a difficult test and a student obtained a mark of 70\% on this test.
Although 72\% is a B-, since the test was difficult, this may be a good score. 
In fact, the student who scored 72\% is in the $90^{th}$ percentile for this test. 
This means that they scored better than 90\% of the rest of the class.
:::


### Quartiles

Quartiles are special cases of percentiles.

::: {.definition name="Quartiles" #Quartiles}
In an ordered data set, quartiles are three values which divide the data into four groups such that each group consists of one fourth of the data. The three quartiles are the:

-	First Quartile (Q$_{1}$)	:	A value such that 25\% (i.e. a quarter) of all observations lie below it.
-	Second Quartile (Q$_{2}$)	:	A value such that 50\% (i.e. two quarters) of all observations lie below it.
-	Third Quartile (Q$_{3}$)	:	A value such that 75\% (i.e. three quarters) of all observations lie below it.
:::


::: {.remark}
The second quartile ($Q_2$) in Definition \@ref(def:Quartiles) is the same as the *median* in Definition \@ref(def:Median)
:::

<!-- ::: {#note:skewnote .note name="Skewness Note"} -->
<!-- **Note:** The second quartile ($Q_2$) in Definition \@ref(def:Quartiles) is the same as the *median* in Definition \@ref(def:Median). -->
<!-- ::: -->

We work with quartiles since they provide an intuitive way to partition data into quarters, and quartiles are also used in graphical summaries discussed in Section \@ref(sec:GraphicalTechniques).

A measure of dispersion involving quartiles is the interquartile range (IQR).

::: {.definition name="Interquartile Range" #IQR}
The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile.
$$\text{IQR} = Q_{3} - Q_{1}$$
where $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$ are the first and third quartiles respectively in Definition \@ref(def:Quartiles).
:::

## Graphical Techniques {#sec:GraphicalTechniques} 

Raw values on their own can be difficult to interpret, especially with very large data sets. 
Graphical representations can be very useful for representing information. 
When implemented correctly, graphical plots can provide more intuitive and direct method to interpret information being analyzed.

We begin this section by introducing a term to describe the shape of a distribution of data.

::: {.definition name="Skewness" }
Skewness refers to such a measure of symmetry or lack of symmetry in the distribution of data.
:::

We can describe data as being left skewed, right skewed or symmetric. If the data is
described as symmetric, this implies that most observations are concentrated around the
mean and tail off fairly evenly on both sides of the mean. If the data is described as right
skewed, this implies that more observations are concentrated on smaller
values and we observe a longer tail to the right side of the mean. If the data is described
as left skewed, this implies that more observations are concentrated on
large values and we observe a longer tail to the left side of the mean. 
We also may have data that is bimodal, which means that there are two distinct peaks in the distribution of the data.


::: {.remark}
*Right* skewed data is also referred to as *positively* skewed and *left* skewed data is also referred to as *negatively* skewed.
:::

Figures \@ref(fig:LeftSkewExample), \@ref(fig:RightSkewExample) and \@ref(fig:SymmetryExample) illustrate types of skewness.

<!-- ::: {#note:skewnote .note name="Skewness Note"} -->
<!-- **Note:** *Right* skewed data is also referred to as *positively* skewed and *left* skewed data is also referred to as *negatively* skewed. -->
<!-- ::: -->

Data sets can have points in it which may be unusual or unexpected. 
These terms are called *outliers*.

::: {.definition name="Outlier" }
An outlier is an unusual data point which appears to lie outside the overall pattern of the
rest of the data.
:::

In other words, an outlier falls outside the range in which we would expect to see “typical”
data values. Outliers may be present in data for a variety of reasons such as transcription
error, measurement error, or we may have just measured a rare and unusual observation. In
any case it is not a good practice to simply ignore outliers. All outliers should be investigated
before deciding whether the observation should be included in data analysis or discarded.


### Histograms

Histograms and boxplots are useful tools which can allow us to visually determine
the skewness of a distribution. By noting skewness, we get even more information about
our data. Note however that we may not always be able to determine skewness by visually
observing a histogram. A histogram is similar to a bar chart with the distinction that his-
tograms can only be created for quantitative data.

The width of the bars does not have any numerical meaning for bar charts, however bar
width matters for histograms. They are an important factor in the creation of histograms.
Interval width selection (or bin size selection) is an advanced topic that can be studied ex-
tensively and there are several rules available to select interval widths. However for the scope
of this course we will keep things simple and allow the reader to intuitively choose bin size.
After constructing a histogram, we can change the interval widths until we feel that we have
a picture that is a good representation of our data.

A histogram is constructed by dividing the range of the data into intervals (or bins) and counting how many observations fall into each interval. The intervals are usually of equal width, but this is not a requirement. 

<!-- | Class Interval       | Frequency | Relative Freq.           |        | Cumulative Freq.             | Cumulative Relative Freq.    | -->

              "$F = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{m} f_{i}$")

Rel_Freq = c("$r_{1} = f_{1} / F$",
             "$r_{2} = f_{2} / F$",
             "$r_{3} = f_{3} / F$",
             "\\vdots",
             "$r_{m} = f_{m} / F$",
             "1")

hist_tab = data.frame(class_int, Frequency, Rel_Freq)

colnames(hist_tab) = c("Class Interval", "Frequency", "Relative Freq.")

# hist_tab %>%
#   knitr::kable(full_width = F, caption = "How a histogram is constructed")

kbl(hist_tab, caption = "How a histogram is constructed") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```


The histogram is then created by plotting the intervals on the $x$-axis and the frequency or relative frequency of observations in each interval on the $y$-axis.
When frequency is plotted on the $y$-axis, the histogram is referred to as a frequency histogram and
when relative frequency is plotted on the $y$-axis, the histogram is referred to as a relative frequency histogram.

::: {.remark}
The bin size in table \@ref(tab:histconstruct) is often chosen to be equal size, however it does not necessarily have to be the case and we can have bin sizes of unequal widths.

When we use the term *histogram*, we often refer to a frequency histogram unless otherwise specified.

Some examples of histograms which also illustrate the concept of skewness are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:HistExampleLeft), \@ref(fig:HistExampleRight), and \@ref(fig:HistExampleSymm). The histograms show how the distribution of data can be skewed to the left, skewed to the right, or approximately symmetric.

The bin widths selected can change the appearance of histograms
The interactive application below allows us to examine the effect of bin size on a histogram from the [faithful](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/faithful.html) data set which measures the waiting time between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA.

### Boxplots

Boxplots are another visual aid we can use to present and interpret data. They are one
of the most simple graphical techniques to analyze visually and are therefore usually relatively immediate to interpret. 
Boxplots are also known as *box-and-whisker* plots since they consist of figures resembling boxes along with a series of
lines called whiskers. The whiskers extend from the box to the most extreme observed values that are not considered outliers.
To decide which values are outliers, we compute lower and upper **outlier cutoffs** (also called **fences**) using the $1.5 \times IQR$ rule:

::: {.definition name="Outlier Cutoffs (Fences)" #OutlierCutoffs}
Let $Q_{1}$, $Q_{3}$ and $IQR$ represent the first quartile, third quartile and
interquartile range respectively as defined in \@ref(def:Quartiles) and \@ref(def:IQR) respectively.
Then the **lower cutoff** and **upper cutoff** are:
\[ \text{Lower cutoff} ~ = ~ Q_{1} - 1.5 \times IQR \]
\[ \text{Upper cutoff} ~ = ~ Q_{3} + 1.5 \times IQR \]
Any observed value below the lower cutoff or above the upper cutoff is flagged as a potential **outlier** and plotted as an individual dot beyond the whisker.
The **lower whisker** extends to the smallest observed value still within the lower cutoff, and the **upper whisker** extends to the largest observed value still within the upper cutoff.
:::

The box in a boxplot is divided into two parts, the lower and upper quartiles. The lower quartile is represented by the bottom of the box and the upper quartile is represented by the top of the box. The line inside the box represents the median of the data set.
Box plots can be used to to get a sense of a data set.

Consider the following summary data

```r
# Load required libraries
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Create summary as a named numeric vector
summary_stats <- c(
  Min = 0.500,
  `1st Qu.` = 8.782,
  Median = 9.855,
  Mean = 10.036,
  `3rd Qu.` = 11.521,
  Max = 19.000
)

# Convert to one-row wide format data frame
summary_wide <- as.data.frame(t(summary_stats))

# Create formatted table (HTML for Bookdown)
kable(summary_wide, format = "html", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Summary Statistics") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
```

The summary statistics in Table \@ref(tab:BoxplotData) is represented visually as an interactive boxplot in Figure \@ref(fig:BoxplotExample). 
Hover over the boxplot to identify the median, quartiles and whiskers.

```r
# Load Plotly
library(plotly)

# Base data
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(50, mean = 10, sd = 2)

# Define outliers
outliers <- c(0.5, 1, 18, 19)

x = c(x, outliers)

outlier_labels <- rep("potential outlier", length(outliers))
x_position <- rep(1, length(outliers))  # Align with boxplot

# Create plot
p <- plot_ly() %>%
  # Boxplot
  add_trace(
    x = rep(1, length(x)),
    y = ~x,
    type = "box",
    boxpoints = "none",
    name = "",
    hoverinfo = "y",
    fillcolor = "#00C19A",
    marker = list(color = "#00C19A"),
    line = list(color = 'rgba(0,100,200,1)')
  ) %>%
  # Custom outliers
  add_trace(
    x = ~x_position,
    y = ~outliers,
    type = "scatter",
    mode = "markers",
    marker = list(
      color = "#F8766D",
      size = 8,
      line = list(color = "#FF68A1", width = 1)
    ),
    hoverinfo = "text",
    hovertext = outlier_labels,
    showlegend = FALSE
  ) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Interactive Boxplot<br>(Hover over outliers)",
    yaxis = list(
      title = "Values",
      range = c(0, 21)        # Set y-axis limits
    ),
    xaxis = list(
      showticklabels = FALSE,
      title = NA,
      range = c(0.5, 1.5)
    )
  )

# Disable lasso and box select tools
config(
  p,
  modeBarButtonsToRemove = c("select2d", "lasso2d")
)
```

Boxplots can also efficiently be used to compare multiple distributions and highlight skewness, spread, and outliers from each of them.
If the median cuts the box with upper area smaller than lower area,
then we say that box-plot with left skew probability distribution. Or,
if the median cuts the box with upper area larger than lower area,
then we say that box-plot with right skew probability distribution.
Otherwise, if the median cuts the box with upper area equal to
lower area, then we say that box-plot with symmetric probability
distribution.

(a) (1 mark) Based on the dot plot, does the distribution appear **left-skewed, right-skewed, or roughly symmetric**? Justify briefly.
(b) (2 marks) Using the values shown in the dot plot, calculate the **mean** $\bar{x}$ and find the **median**.
(c) (1 mark) Identify the **mode**.
(d) (2 marks) The value 12 is unusually large. If it is removed from the dataset, recalculate the mean and state whether the median changes. What does this tell you about the **sensitivity** of the mean vs. the median to extreme values?

- Read off all 10 values from the x-axis — count stacked dots carefully.
- For $n = 10$ (even), median $=$ average of the 5th and 6th ordered values.
- Removing an extreme value changes the sum and hence the mean; the median depends only on rank.

**Data from dot plot (sorted):** 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 12

**(a)** **Right-skewed** — most students walk 3–6 thousand steps, but the values 8 and 12 form a long tail to the right.

**(b)** Using $\bar{x} = \dfrac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$ with $n = 10$:
$$\bar{x} = \frac{3+4+4+5+5+5+6+6+8+12}{10} = \frac{58}{10} = \mathbf{5.8} \text{ thousand steps}$$
Median $=$ average of 5th and 6th ordered values $= \dfrac{5+5}{2} = \mathbf{5}$ thousand steps.

**(a)** The distribution is **right-skewed** — most students exercise between 0 and 8 hours per week (the tall bars on the left), while a few students exercise much more, creating a long tail extending to the right toward 20+ hours.

**(b)** Add bar heights for intervals 10–12, 12–14, 14–16, and beyond. Reading from the histogram, approximately 5–8 students exercise more than 10 hours per week.

**(a)** From the plot: $Q_1 = 79$, Median $= 90$, $Q_3 = 101.5$. The lower whisker extends to Min $= 52$ (the smallest value, which is within the cutoffs). The **upper whisker** extends to $\mathbf{115}$ — the largest non-outlier value. The actual data maximum is **170**, visible as the topmost outlier dot (not the whisker tip). All reasonable estimates will be marked correct.

**(b)** $\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1 = 101.5 - 79 = \mathbf{22.5}$

**(c)** Apply the $1.5 \times \text{IQR}$ outlier rule:
$$\text{Lower cutoff} = Q_1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR} = 79 - 1.5(22.5) = 79 - 33.75 = \mathbf{45.25}$$
$$\text{Upper cutoff} = Q_3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR} = 101.5 + 1.5(22.5) = 101.5 + 33.75 = \mathbf{135.25}$$
The three dots above the upper whisker — at approximately **\$145, \$158, and \$170** — all exceed the upper cutoff and are **high outliers**.

**Values from dot plot:** 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8

**(a)** The **Morning Section** distribution is roughly **symmetric** — bars are spread in a bell shape centred around 65–70. The **Evening Section** distribution is **right-skewed** — most students score in the 40–70 range, but a long right tail extends toward 90+.

**(b)** The **Evening Section** — its right skew means the long tail of high scores pulls the mean above the median. The Morning Section's symmetric shape means mean $\approx$ median.

**(c)** Add bar heights for 60–70, 70–80, 80–90, and 90–100 in the Morning Section. Reading from the histogram, approximately 24–28 students score 60 or above.
$$\text{Proportion} \approx \frac{26}{35} \approx 0.74 \quad (74\%)$$
All reasonable estimates will be marked correct.

**(d)** The **Evening Section** appears to have greater variability — its histogram spans a wider overall range (approximately 30 to 100) with scores spread across many intervals, while the Morning Section is more tightly clustered around its centre. A wider spread in the histogram indicates greater variability.

**(a)** Using the equal-halves method: Min $= 19$, $Q_1 = 22.5$, Median $= 26$, $Q_3 = 30.5$, Max $= 40$.

**(b)** $\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1 = 30.5 - 22.5 = \mathbf{8}$

**(c)** Apply the $1.5 \times \text{IQR}$ outlier rule:
$$\text{Lower cutoff} = Q_1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR} = 22.5 - 1.5(8) = 22.5 - 12 = \mathbf{10.5}$$
$$\text{Upper cutoff} = Q_3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR} = 30.5 + 1.5(8) = 30.5 + 12 = \mathbf{42.5}$$
All values lie within $[10.5,\ 42.5]$, so there are **no outliers** — even the oldest participant (age 40) falls inside the upper cutoff.

*Note: Different quartile methods can give slightly different values for $Q_1$ and $Q_3$, so the red dashed lines on the plot may not align exactly with your calculated cutoffs. The conclusion — no outliers — is the same regardless of method.*

<summary>✅ Answer</summary>
<div class="content">
**(a)** **Group B** — its scores range from 8 to 20 (wide spread), while Group A's scores cluster tightly between 14 and 16.

**(b)** Using $s^2 = \dfrac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$ and $s = \sqrt{s^2}$:

**Group A** ($n = 10$, $\bar{x}_A = 150/10 = 15$):

| $x_i$ | $x_i - 15$ | $(x_i - 15)^2$ |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| 14 | $-1$ | $1$ |
| 15 | $0$ | $0$ |
| 14 | $-1$ | $1$ |
| 16 | $1$ | $1$ |
| 15 | $0$ | $0$ |
| 14 | $-1$ | $1$ |
| 16 | $1$ | $1$ |
| 15 | $0$ | $0$ |
| 15 | $0$ | $0$ |
| 16 | $1$ | $1$ |
| | **Sum** | **6** |

$$s_A^2 = \frac{6}{9} \approx 0.667 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s_A = \sqrt{0.667} \approx \mathbf{0.816}$$

**Group B** ($n = 10$, $\bar{x}_B = 150/10 = 15$):

| $x_i$ | $x_i - 15$ | $(x_i - 15)^2$ |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| 8 | $-7$ | $49$ |
| 12 | $-3$ | $9$ |
| 15 | $0$ | $0$ |
| 19 | $4$ | $16$ |
| 18 | $3$ | $9$ |
| 11 | $-4$ | $16$ |
| 17 | $2$ | $4$ |
| 20 | $5$ | $25$ |
| 20 | $5$ | $25$ |
| 10 | $-5$ | $25$ |
| | **Sum** | **178** |

$$s_B^2 = \frac{178}{9} \approx 19.78 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s_B = \sqrt{19.78} \approx \mathbf{4.45}$$

Group B's standard deviation is much larger, confirming the visual observation.

**(c)** Both groups have the **same mean** ($\bar{x}_A = \bar{x}_B = 15$), yet their standard deviations are very different ($s_A \approx 0.816$, $s_B \approx 4.45$). This illustrates that the mean alone is **insufficient** to fully describe a dataset — the standard deviation is also needed to capture how spread out the values are.

**R code:**

```r
groupA <- c(14, 15, 14, 16, 15, 14, 16, 15, 15, 16)
groupB <- c( 8, 12, 15, 19, 18, 11, 17, 20, 20, 10)

# Compute mean and SD for each group
mean(groupA)   # [1] 15
sd(groupA)     # [1] 0.8164966
mean(groupB)   # [1] 15
sd(groupB)     # [1] 4.447221

# Create a side-by-side boxplot to compare the spread
boxplot(groupA, groupB,
        names = c("Group A", "Group B"),
        main  = "Quiz Scores: Group A vs Group B",
        ylab  = "Score (out of 20)",
        col   = c("#74b9ff", "#fd79a8"))
```

Both groups have mean $= 15$, confirming Q11(c). The side-by-side boxplot makes the difference in spread immediately visible — Group B's box is far wider than Group A's.

<summary>✅ Answer</summary>
<div class="content">
**Sorted data:** 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 30

**(a)** With $n = 12$ (even), median $=$ average of the $\dfrac{n}{2} = 6$th and $\dfrac{n}{2}+1 = 7$th ordered values:
$$\text{Median} = \frac{x_{(6)} + x_{(7)}}{2} = \frac{7 + 8}{2} = \mathbf{7.5} \text{ minutes}$$

**(b)** Split the 12 sorted values into two halves of 6:

- Lower half: 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7 → $Q_1 = \dfrac{5+5}{2} = \mathbf{5}$
- Upper half: 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 30 → $Q_3 = \dfrac{10+12}{2} = \mathbf{11}$

**(c)** $\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1 = 11 - 5 = \mathbf{6}$ minutes.

**(d)** Apply the $1.5 \times \text{IQR}$ outlier rule:
$$\text{Lower cutoff} = Q_1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR} = 5 - 1.5(6) = 5 - 9 = \mathbf{-4}$$
$$\text{Upper cutoff} = Q_3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR} = 11 + 1.5(6) = 11 + 9 = \mathbf{20}$$
Since $30 > 20$, the value **30 is a high outlier**.

**R code:**

```r
x <- c(3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 30)

# Six-number summary (Min, Q1, Median, Mean, Q3, Max)
summary(x)
#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
#    3.00    5.00    7.50    9.33   10.50   30.00

# IQR and outlier cutoffs
IQR(x)                    # [1] 5.5
5.00 - 1.5 * IQR(x)       # lower cutoff: -3.25
10.50 + 1.5 * IQR(x)      # upper cutoff: 18.75

# Create a horizontal boxplot
boxplot(x, horizontal = TRUE,
        main = "Bus Waiting Times (minutes)",
        xlab = "Minutes", col = "#00cec9")
```

R's `summary()` gives $Q_1 = 5$ and $Q_3 = 10.5$ (slightly different from the textbook split-halves $Q_3 = 11$), so R's IQR $= 5.5$ and upper cutoff $= 18.75$. Both methods agree: **30 is a high outlier**. The boxplot shows 30 as an isolated dot above the upper whisker.

**(b)(ii)** Restaurant A ≈ **75–80%** of deliveries ≤ 40 min; Restaurant B ≈ **85–90%** of deliveries ≤ 40 min.

**(b)(iii)** **Restaurant A** is the sushi restaurant — its symmetric distribution reflects **consistent preparation times**, characteristic of careful sushi preparation. Restaurant B's right-skewed distribution with outliers is consistent with pizza delivery, where most orders are fast but large rush orders occasionally cause extreme delays.

The histogram below shows the annual salaries (in thousands of dollars) of employees at a tech company.

```r
set.seed(15)
salaries <- c(round(rlnorm(70, log(75), 0.35)), round(rlnorm(10, log(200), 0.25)))
salaries <- pmin(salaries, 400)
df_q15 <- data.frame(salary = salaries)

```

(a) (2 marks) Describe the **shape** of this salary distribution. Identify the direction of skew and justify using features of the histogram.
(b) (2 marks) Based on the shape, would you expect the **mean salary** to be greater than, less than, or approximately equal to the **median salary**? Explain.
(c) (1 mark) A reporter states: *"The average salary at this company is \$95,000, so most employees earn around that amount."* Is this statement likely to be **misleading**? Explain why.
(d) (2 marks) Which single measure — **mean** or **median** — would better represent a **typical** employee's salary in this company? Justify your answer.

<div class="content">
- In a **right-skewed** distribution, a small number of very high values pull the **mean** above the **median**.
- The "average" (mean) can be misleading when data are skewed because it does not reflect where most data points fall.

</details>

<details data-type="answer">
<summary>✅ Answer</summary>
<div class="content">
**(a)** The distribution is **right-skewed** — most employees earn between \$50,000 and \$125,000 (the tall bars on the left), but a small number of high earners (possibly executives) create a long tail extending to the right toward \$300,000–\$400,000.

**(b)** We would expect the **mean > median** — the high-earning outliers in the long right tail pull the mean upward, while the median (the middle value) is not affected as strongly.

**(c)** Yes, this is likely **misleading**. If the distribution is right-skewed, most employees earn *less* than the mean. The mean is inflated by a small number of very high earners (executives), so it does not represent a "typical" employee's salary.

**(d)** The **median** better represents a typical employee's salary — it is robust to the influence of high-earning outliers and accurately reflects where the middle of the salary distribution falls.

<div class="exercise-label">Question 18</div>
For each situation below, choose the most appropriate graph: **bar chart**, **histogram**, or **boxplot**. Briefly explain your choice.

*Recall: a **bar chart** displays counts or frequencies for the categories of a qualitative (categorical) variable — bar width has no numerical meaning. A **histogram** displays the distribution of a quantitative variable by grouping values into intervals. A **boxplot** summarises a quantitative variable using its five-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum) and flags potential outliers.*

(a) (1 mark) A professor wants to display the number of students enrolled in each program: Statistics, Computer Science, Biology, and Psychology.
(b) (1 mark) A researcher wants to show the distribution of commute times for 200 students.
(c) (2 marks) A teaching assistant wants to compare the distribution of test scores between two tutorial sections.
(d) (1 mark) A student wants to display the frequency of different eye colours in a class.

<summary>✅ Answer</summary>
<div class="content">
**(a)** **Bar chart** — program is a categorical variable, and a bar chart displays the count or frequency for each category.

**(b)** **Histogram** — commute time is a quantitative variable; a histogram shows the shape, centre, and spread of its distribution.

**(c)** **Boxplot** — side-by-side boxplots are ideal for comparing the centre, spread, and outliers of a quantitative variable across two or more groups.

**(d)** **Bar chart** — eye colour is categorical with no natural ordering, so a bar chart is appropriate.

**(a)** The histogram is roughly **bell-shaped and symmetric** for scores between 60 and 97. The score of **40** appears as an isolated bar far to the left — the distribution is mildly **left-skewed** with one potential low outlier.

**(b)** The **median** (line inside the box) is approximately **79**. The box spans roughly $Q_1 \approx 71$ to $Q_3 \approx 86$. The value **40** appears as an isolated dot below the lower whisker — it is flagged as an **outlier** by the IQR rule. This is consistent with what the histogram showed.
