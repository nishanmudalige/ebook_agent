# Hypothesis Tests

## Introduction 

A hypothesis test is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. It involves formulating a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, calculating a test statistic, and determining the likelihood of observing the data under the null hypothesis. Each of these terms will be explained in more detail below.

::: {.definition}
An inferential procedure to determine whether there is sufficient
evidence to suggest a condition for a population parameter using
statistics from a sample.
:::

The main goal of hypothesis testing is to assess the strength of evidence against a null hypothesis, which is a statement of no effect or no difference. The alternative hypothesis represents the research hypothesis or the condition we are interested in testing.

One of the steps in hypothesis testing is to calculate a p-value, which quantifies the evidence against the null hypothesis. The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one calculated from the sample data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

::: {.definition}
The p-value of a hypothesis test is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one calculated in step 3, assuming that the null hypothesis is true by pure chance alone.
:::


The procedure to conduct any hypothesis often follows a standard sequence of steps.

##### Steps {.unnumbered .unlisted}

**[ [Reorder and start with checking assumptions first?] ]{style="color: red"}**


1.  Decide on a level of significance ($\alpha$).

2.  State the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_a$).
    
3.  Calculate the appropriate test statistic.

4.  Use the test statistic and a reference distribution to calculate a
    p-value.

5.  Compare p-value to $\alpha$ to make a conclusion.

We will now examine each of the steps above in more detail.

**Step 1: Decide on a Level of Significance ($\alpha$)**

This is a threshold for decision making which the study or researcher is willing to implement.
Depends on tolerance for consequences of errors, sample size, nature of
the study, and variability.

Some common Common values are $\alpha = 0.10$, $\alpha = 0.05$, $\alpha = 0.01$.


**Step 2: State the Null Hypothesis and the Alternative Hypothesis**

We will use the following notation for describing the null and alternative hypotheses:

<table class="param-table">
  <tr>
    <pd class="term">$\Theta$</td>
    <pd class="sep"> : </pd>
    <pd class="alt">Parameter of interest.</pd>
  </tr>
</table>

<table class="param-table">
  <tr>
    <pd class="term">$\Theta_0$</td>
    <pd class="sep"> : </pd>
    <pd class="alt">Numerical value hypothesized under the null hypothesis.</pd>
  </tr>
</table>

::: {.remark}
Note that $\Theta$ can represent a combination of parameters, 
such as $\Theta = \Theta_1 - \Theta_2$ 
or $\Theta = \Theta_1 / \Theta_2$.
:::

<!-- <table class="param-table"> -->
<!--   <tr> -->
<!--     <pd class="term">$\Theta_0$</pd> -->
<!--     <pd class="sep"> : </pd> -->
<!--     <pd class="alt">Numerical value of the parameter of interest hypothesized under the null hypothesis.</pd> -->
<!--   </tr> -->
<!-- </table> -->

<!-- $$\begin{array}{lcl} -->
<!-- \Theta    & : & \text{parameter of interest}\\ -->
<!-- \Theta_0  & : & \text{numerical value of the parameter of interest hypothesized under the}\\ -->
<!--           &   & \text{null hypothesis.} -->
<!-- \end{array}$$ -->

A hypothesis test is a comparison between two mutually exclusive hypotheses which are:



<table class="definition-table">
  <tr>
    <td>Null hypothesis $(H_0)$</td>
    <td>: </td>
    <td>Represents the current belief or the conservative belief or the status quo. It is a statement of no effect or no difference.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alternative hypothesis $(H_a)$</td>
    <td>: </td>
    <td>Represents the research hypothesis, or what you are requested to test or trying to prove.</td>
  </tr>
</table>




<!-- ::: {.smalltblfit} -->
<!-- | Null hypothesis        | Represents the current belief or the conservative Represents the current belief or the conservative Represents the current belief or the conservative Represents the current belief or the conservative Represents the current belief or the conservative |  -->
<!-- | :--------------------- | :----------   |  -->
<!-- | Alternative hypothesis | $x_1$ | -->
<!-- ::: -->



<!-- $$\begin{array}{lcl} -->
<!-- \text{Null hypothesis} \, (H_0)         & : & \text{Represents the current belief or the conservative}\\ -->
<!--                                         &   & \text{belief or the status quo. It is a statement of no effect}\\ -->
<!--                                         &   & \text{or no difference.}\\ -->
<!-- \text{Alternative hypothesis} \, (H_a)  & : & \text{Represents the research hypothesis, or what you are}\\ -->
<!--                                         &   & \text{requested to test or trying to prove).} -->
<!-- \end{array}$$ -->

Our choices for the null and alternative hypothesis are:

<!-- $$\begin{array}{lccl} -->
<!-- H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0 & (\Theta \leq \Theta_0) & \quad & H_a: \Theta > \Theta_0 \quad {\text{one-sided (one-tailed)}} \\ -->
<!-- H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0 & (\Theta \geq \Theta_0) &       & H_a: \Theta < \Theta_0 \quad {\text{one-sided (one-tailed)}} \\ -->
<!-- H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0 &                        &       & H_a: \Theta \neq \Theta_0 \quad {\text{two-sided (two-tailed)}} -->
<!-- \end{array}$$ -->

<!-- $$\begin{array}{l lcl} -->
<!-- 1. &  H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0 & \quad  & H_a: \Theta > \Theta_0\\ -->
<!-- 2. &  H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0 &        & H_a: \Theta < \Theta_0\\ -->
<!-- 3. &  H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0 &        & H_a: \Theta \neq \Theta_0 -->
<!-- \end{array}$$ -->

<!-- - $H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0$ vs. $H_a: \Theta > \Theta_0$ -->
<!-- - $H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0$ vs. $H_a: \Theta < \Theta_0$ -->
<!-- - $H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0$ vs. $H_a: \Theta \neq \Theta$ -->


<table class="hypothesis-table">
  <tr>
    <td class="term">$H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0$</td>
    <td class="sep">vs.</td>
    <td class="alt">$H_a: \Theta > \Theta_0$</td>

:::{.remark}
The first two hypothesis tests above are referred to as one-sided or one-tailed tests.
and the third hypothesis test is referred to as a two-sided or two-tailed test.
:::

:::{.remark}
The one-sided hypothesis test 
$$\begin{array}{lcl}
H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0 & \quad  & H_a: \Theta > \Theta_0\\
\end{array}$$
is equivalent to
$$\begin{array}{lcl}
H_0: \Theta \leq \Theta_0 & \quad  & H_a: \Theta > \Theta_0\\
\end{array}$$

and the other one-sided hypothesis test 

$$\begin{array}{lcl}
H_0: \Theta = \Theta_0 & \quad  & H_a: \Theta < \Theta_0\\
\end{array}$$
is equivalent to
$$\begin{array}{lcl}
H_0: \Theta \geq \Theta_0 & \quad  & H_a: \Theta < \Theta_0\\
\end{array}$$
:::


**Step 3: Calculate an appropriate test statistic**

Depends on the hypothesis test conducted and the information available.

::: definition
$$\text{test statistic} = \frac{\text{(a statistic)} - \text{(hypothesized value of parameters under } H_0 \text{)}}{\text{standard error of statistic}}$$
:::

The test statistic follows a reference distribution. 
Common distributions which thetest statistic follows are the standard normal distrubution, $t$-distribution, 
$F$-distribution and $\chi^2$-distribution.
<!-- $Z$, $t$, $F$, $\chi^2$ -->

**Step 4: Calculate the p-value**

<!-- It quantifies the evidence against the null hypothesis. -->

We use the test statistic, reference distribution, and refer back to $H_a$.

**Step 5: Compare *p*-value to level of significance $\alpha$ and make a conclusion**

- If the *p*-value $< \alpha$, we say there is sufficient evidence against $H_0$ and the hypothesis test rejects $H_0$
  in favor of $H_a$.

- If the *p*-value $> \alpha$, thenwe say there is insufficient evidence against $H_0$ and we do not reject $H_0$ 
  (in this situation we can also say fail to reject $H_0$).

<!-- **Note:** It is not good practice to give conclusions in the context of -->
<!-- stating we *accept $H_0$* or *accept $H_a$*. -->


**About the p-value of the test statistics**

- The p-value is a conditional probability.

- It is not the probability that $H_0$ (null hypothesis: current belief)
  is true.

- It is: P(observed statistic value --- $H_0$).
  Given $H_0$ (the null hypothesis), because $H_0$ gives the parameter
  values that we need to find required probability.

- The p-value serves as a measure of the strength of the evidence against
  the null hypothesis (but it should not serve as a hard and fast rule
  for decision).

- If the p-value = 0.03 (for example) all we can say is that there is 3%
  chance of observing the statistic value we actually observed (or one
  even more inconsistent with the null value).

- The p-value is the chance (the proportion) of getting a, for instance,
  $\hat{p}$ as far as or further from $H_0$ than the value observed.

- The p-value is the probability of getting at least something (e.g., sample
  proportion $\hat{p}$) more extreme (e.g., unusual, unlikely, or rare)
  than what we have already found (our observed value of $\hat{p}$) that
  provide even stronger evidence against $H_0$.

- The more extreme the z-score (large in absolute values) are the ones
  that denote farther departure of the observed value (e.g., our
  $\hat{p}$) from the parameter value ($p_0$) in $H_0$.

- In the one-sided test, e.g., $H_a : p > p_0$, p-value is one-tailed
  probability. This is the probability that sample proportion $\hat{p}$
  falls at least as far from $p_0$ in one direction as the observed
  value of $\hat{p}$.

- In the two-sided test, e.g., $H_a : p \ne p_0$, p-value is two-tailed
  probability. This is the probability that sample proportion $\hat{p}$
  falls at least as far from $p_0$ in either direction as the observed
  value of $\hat{p}$.

The probability, computed assuming that $H_0$ is true, that the test
statistic would take a value as extreme or more extreme than that
actually observed is called the **P-value** of the test. The smaller the
P-value, the stronger the evidence against $H_0$ provided by the data.

Small P-values are evidence against $H_0$, because they say that the
observed result is unlikely to occur when $H_0$ is true. Large P-values
fail to give evidence against $H_0$.

**The P-value Scale**

- If P-value $<$ 0.001, we have very strong evidence against $H_0$.

- If 0.001 $\leq$ P-value $<$ 0.01, we have strong evidence against
  $H_0$.

- If 0.01 $\leq$ P-value $<$ 0.05, we have evidence against $H_0$.

- If 0.05 $\leq$ P-value $<$ 0.075, we have some evidence against $H_0$.

- If 0.075 $\leq$ P-value $<$ 0.10, we have slight evidence against
  $H_0$.

**Use p-value Method to Make a Decision (Reject or Fail to Reject
$H_0$)**

But how small is small p-value?\
We would need to choose an $\alpha$-level (significance-level): a number
such that if:

- $P\text{–value} \leq \alpha$-level, we reject $H_0$; We can conclude
  $H_a$ (we have evidence to support our claim). Often we phrase as a
  statistically significant result at that specified $\alpha$-level.

- $P\text{–value} > \alpha$-level, we fail to reject $H_0$; We cannot
  conclude $H_a$ (we have not enough evidence to support our claim;
  thus, $H_0$ is plausible - We do not accept $H_0$). Often we phrase as
  the result is not statistically significant at that specified
  $\alpha$-level.

- The default $\alpha$-level (significance-level) is typically
  $\alpha = 0.05$ (but it can be different based on the context of the
  study - it is usually not higher than 0.10).

The p-value in the previous example was extremely small (less than
0.0001). That is a strong evidence to suggest that more than 5% of
children have genetic abnormalities. However, it does not say that the
percentage of sampled children with genetic abnormalities was "a lot
more than 5%". That is, the p-value by itself says nothing about how
much greater the percentage might be. The confidence interval provides
that information.\
To assess the difference in practical terms, we should also construct a
confidence interval:

$$0.1198 \pm (1.96 \times 0.0166)$$ $$0.1198 \pm 0.0324$$
$$(0.0874,\ 0.1522)$$

Interpretation: We are 95% Confident that the true percentage of
children with genetic abnormalities is between 8.74% and 15.22%.\
95% CI for $p$: (9.1%, 15.6%) -- We are 95% confident that the true
percentage of all children that have genetic abnormalities is between
approximately 9.1% and 15.6%. Since both values of this CI are more than
the hypothesized value of $p = 0.05$ (5%), we can further infer that
this true percentage is more than 5%.\
**Do environmental chemicals cause congenital abnormalities?**

We do not know that environmental chemicals cause genetic abnormalities.
We merely have evidence that suggests that a greater percentage of
children are diagnosed with genetic abnormalities now, compared to the
1980s.

**More About P-values**

- Big p-values just mean that what we have observed is not surprising.
  It means that the results are in line with our assumption that the
  null hypothesis models the world, so we have no reason to reject it.

- A big p-value does not prove that the null hypothesis is true.

- When we see a big p-value, all we can say is: we cannot reject $H_0$
  (we fail to reject $H_0$) -- we cannot conclude $H_a$ (We have no
  evidence to support $H_a$).














## One Sample Hypothesis Tests

### On a Population Mean

#### When $\sigma$ is Known


<!-- Draw a simple random sample of size $n$ from a Normal population that -->
<!-- has unknown mean $\mu$ and known standard deviation $\sigma$.  -->
To test $H_0 : \mu = \mu_0$, in the situation where the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is known,
our options for the null and alternative hypotheses are:

- $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu > \mu_0$

- $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu < \mu_0$

- $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu \neq \mu_0$

<!-- <table class="hypothesis-table"> -->
<!--   <tr> -->
<!--     <td class="term" style="text-align: left !important;">$H_0: \mu = \mu_0$</td> -->
<!--     <td class="sep" style="text-align: left !important;">vs.</td> -->
<!--     <td class="alt" style="text-align: left !important;">$H_a: \mu > \mu_0$</td> -->
<!--   </tr> -->
<!--   <tr> -->
<!--     <td class="term" style="text-align: left !important;">$H_0: \mu = \mu_0$</td> -->
<!--     <td class="sep" style="text-align: left !important;">vs.</td> -->
<!--     <td class="alt" style="text-align: left !important;">$H_a: \mu < \mu_0$</td> -->
<!--   </tr> -->
<!--   <tr> -->
<!--     <td class="term" style="text-align: left !important;">$H_0: \mu = \mu_0$</td> -->
<!--     <td class="sep" style="text-align: left !important;">vs.</td> -->
<!--     <td class="alt" style="text-align: left !important;">$H_a: \mu \neq \mu_0$</td> -->
<!--   </tr> -->
<!-- </table> -->


We calculate the $z$-statistic:

$$z^{*} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \sim N(0,1)$$

The reference distribution is the standard normal distribution.

In terms of a variable $Z$ having the standard normal distribution, the
p-value for a test of $H_0$ against:

- $H_a: \mu > \mu_0$ is $P(Z > z^{*})$

- $H_a: \mu < \mu_0$ is $P(Z < z^{*})$

- $H_a: \mu \ne \mu_0$ is $2P(Z > |z^{*}|)$


::::: example
Deer are a common sight on the UTM campus. Suppose an ecologist is
interested in the average mass of adult white-tailed does (female deer)
around the Mississauga campus to determine whether they are healthy for
the upcoming winter. The ecologist captures a sample of 36 adult females
around the UTM and measures the average mass of this sample to be 42.53
kg.

From previous studies conducted in the area, the average mass of healthy
does was reported to be 45 kg. Conduct a hypothesis test at the 5%
significance level to determine whether the mass of does around UTM has
decreased. Assume the standard deviation is known to be 5.25 kg.

**1. Level of significance.** $\alpha = 0.05$

**2. State the null and alternative hypotheses.**
$$H_0: \mu = 45 \qquad H_a: \mu < 45$$

**3. Calculate appropriate test statistic.**

Given: $$n = 36, \quad \bar{x} = 42.53, \quad \sigma = 5.25$$

Since $\sigma$ is known, the test statistic is:
$$z^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{42.53 - 45}{5.25/\sqrt{36}} = -2.82$$

Reference distribution: standard normal

**4. Calculate p-value**

$$\text{p-value} = P(Z < -2.82) \approx 0.0024$$
```r
library(ggplot2)

# Normal curve data
x <- seq(-4, 4, length = 1000)
y <- dnorm(x)

# Shaded left-tail region
test_stat <- -2.82
p_x <- seq(-4, test_stat, length = 500)
p_y <- dnorm(p_x)

# Bracket near pink area
x_left <- -3.6
x_right <- test_stat - 0.1
y_bot <- 0.005
y_mid <- 0.028
y_top <- 0.04

# Build plot
p <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x, y), color = "#000000", linewidth = 1.4) +
  geom_area(aes(x = p_x, y = p_y), fill = "#DC71FA", alpha = 0.65) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "#000000", linewidth = 1.1) +

  # Test statistic line and label
  geom_segment(aes(x = test_stat, xend = test_stat, y = 0, yend = dnorm(test_stat)), 
               color = "#000000", linewidth = 1.2) +
  annotate("text", x = test_stat, y = -0.02, label = "z* = -2.82", size = 6, fontface = "italic") +

  annotate("text", x = (x_left + x_right)/2, y = y_top, label = "p-value", size = 5.2) +

  # Hypotheses
  annotate("text", x = 2.4, y = 0.32, label = "H[0]:~mu==45", parse = TRUE, size = 6.2) +
  annotate("text", x = 2.4, y = 0.26, label = "H[a]:~mu < 45", parse = TRUE, size = 6.2) +

  # Axes
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-4, -2, 0, 2, 4), limits = c(-4, 4), expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-0.03, 0.42)) +

  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  )

p
```


**5. Compare p-value with level of significance $\alpha$ and make a
conclusion:**

$$0.0024 < 0.05 \Rightarrow \text{p-value} < \alpha$$

There is sufficient evidence at the 5% level of significance to reject
the null that does this winter weigh the same as in the past and to
conclude the alternative that does this winter weigh less than 45 kg.

**R code:**

```r
    # Find test stat
    z_test_stat = (42.53 - 45) / (5.25 / sqrt(36))
    z_test_stat
    [1] -2.822857

    # Find the p-value
    # Since the alternative is Ha : mu < 45
    p-value = pnorm(z_test_stat)
    [1] 0.00237989
```

*Note:* The `pnorm()` function in R, by default, returns the cumulative
probability (area) to the left of the given value.\

**R code: Using BSDA package**

```r
    # Using the BSDA library. install BSDA if it is not already installed.
    # install.packages("BSDA")
    > library(BSDA)
    > # Conduct the z-test with the zsum.test function
    > zsum.test(mean.x = 42.53, sigma.x = 5.24, n.x = 36, mu = 45, alternative = "less")

            One-sample z-Test

    data:  Summarized x
    z = -2.8282, p-value = 0.00234
    alternative hypothesis: true mean is less than 45
    95 percent confidence interval:
     NA 43.96651
    sample estimates:
    mean of x 
        42.53 
```

**Interpretation:**

There is sufficient evidence at the 5% level of significance to reject
the null hypothesis. We conclude that the average mass of does this
winter is significantly less than 45 kg.

:::::: example
Diet colas use artificial sweeteners to avoid sugar. These sweeteners
gradually lose their sweetness over time. Manufacturers therefore test
new colas for loss of sweetness before marketing them. Trained tasters
sip the cola along with drinks of standard sweetness and score the cola
on a "sweetness score" of 1 to 10. The cola is then stored for a month
at high temperature to imitate the effect of four months' storage at
room temperature. Each taster scores the cola again after storage. This
is a matched pairs experiment. Our data are the differences (score
before storage minus score after storage) in the tasters' scores. The
bigger these differences, the bigger the loss of sweetness.

Suppose we know that for any cola, the sweetness loss scores vary from
taster to taster according to a Normal distribution with standard
deviation $\sigma = 1$. The mean $\mu$ for all tasters measures loss of
sweetness.

The following are the sweetness losses for a new cola as measured by 10
trained tasters:

$$2.0, 0.4, 0.7, 2.0, -0.4, 2.2, -1.3, 1.2, 1.1, 2.3$$

Are these data good evidence that the cola lost sweetness in storage?\
**Solution**\
$\mu$ = mean sweetness loss for the population of **all** tasters.\
**Step 1:** State hypotheses. $$\begin{aligned}
H_0 &: \mu = 0 \\
H_a &: \mu > 0
\end{aligned}$$ **Step 2:** Test statistic:
$z_\star = \dfrac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} = \dfrac{1.02 - 0}{1 / \sqrt{10}} = 3.23$\
**Step 3:** P-value. $P(Z > z_\star) = P(Z > 3.23) = 0.0006$\
**Step 4:** Conclusion. We would rarely observe a mean as large as 1.02
if $H_0$ were true. The small p-value provides strong evidence against
$H_0$, supporting $H_a: \mu > 0$. That is, the mean sweetness loss is
likely positive.

The National Center for Health Statistics reports that the systolic
blood pressure for males 35 to 44 years of age has mean 128 and standard
deviation 15.

The medical director of a large company looks at the medical records of
72 executives in this age group and finds that the mean systolic blood
pressure in this sample is $\bar{x} = 126.07$. Is this evidence that the
company's executives have a different mean blood pressure from the
general population?

Suppose we know that executives' blood pressures follow a Normal
distribution with standard deviation $\sigma = 15$.

**Solution:** Let $\mu$ be the mean systolic blood pressure of the
executive population.

1.  **State hypotheses:**\
    $$\begin{aligned}
    H_0 &: \mu = 128 \\
    H_a &: \mu \ne 128
    \end{aligned}$$

2.  **Test statistic:**\
    $$z^{*} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{126.07 - 128}{15 / \sqrt{72}} = -1.09$$

3.  **P-value:**\
    $$2P(Z > |z^{*}|) = 2P(Z > 1.09) = 2(1 - 0.8621) = 0.2758$$

4.  **Conclusion:**\
    More than 27% of the time, a simple random sample of size 72 from
    the general male population would have a mean blood pressure at
    least as far from 128 as that of the executive sample. The observed
    $\bar{x} = 126.07$ is therefore not good evidence that executives
    differ from other men.

1.  Compute the value of the test statistic.

#### When $\sigma$ is Not Known

To test $H_0 : \mu = \mu_0$, in the situation where the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is not known,
our options for the null and alternative hypotheses are:

- $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu > \mu_0$

- $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu < \mu_0$

- $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu \neq \mu_0$

We calculate the $t$-statistic:

$$t^{*} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$$

In terms of a variable $T$ which follows a $t$-distribution at $n-1$ degrees of freedom, the
p-value for a test of $H_0$ against:

- $H_a: \mu > \mu_0$ is $P(T > t^{*})$

- $H_a: \mu < \mu_0$ is $P(T < t^{*})$

- $H_a: \mu \ne \mu_0$ is $2P(T > |t^{*}|)$


::: example
Researchers studied the physiological effects of laughter. They measured
heart rates (in beats per minute) of **$n = 25$** subjects (ages 18--34)
while they laughed. They obtained:
$$\bar{x} = 73.5, \quad s = 6, \quad \alpha = 0.05$$ It is well known
that the resting heart rate is 71 bpm. Is there evidence that the mean
heart rate during laughter exceeds 71 bpm?

**Step 1: State the hypotheses.** $$\begin{aligned}
H_0 &: \mu = 71 \\
H_a &: \mu > 71
\end{aligned}$$

**Step 2: Check assumptions.**

- The sample is an independent random sample of individuals aged 18--34.

- The population of heart rates during laughter is normally distributed.

**Step 3: Compute the test statistic.**

Since $\sigma$ is unknown, we use the $t$ statistic:
$$t^\ast = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{73.5 - 71}{6 / \sqrt{25}} = 2.083$$

Reference distribution: $t$ distribution with $n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24$
degrees of freedom.

**Step 4: Determine the p-value.**

Using the $t$ distribution with 24 df: $$0.01 < \text{p-value} < 0.025$$

**Step 5: Make a conclusion.**

Since $\text{p-value} < \alpha = 0.05$, we reject $H_0$.

*There is sufficient evidence at the 5% level of significance to reject
the null that the mean is 71 bpm in favor of the alternative that the
mean is greater than 71 bpm for people who are laughing.*

::::: example
A researcher is asked to test the hypothesis that the average price of a
2-star (CAA rating) motel room has decreased since last year. Last year,
a study showed that the prices were Normally distributed with a mean of
\$89.50.

A random sample of twelve 2-star motels produced the following room
prices:

$$\text{\$85.00, 92.50, 87.50, 89.90, 90.00, 82.50, 87.50, 90.00, 85.00, 89.00, 91.50, 87.50}$$

At the 5% level of significance, can we conclude that the mean price has
decreased?

**Solution:**

Let $\mu$ be the true average price of a 2-star motel room.

1.  **State hypotheses.** $$\begin{aligned}
    H_0 &: \mu = 89.5 \\
    H_a &: \mu < 89.5
    \end{aligned}$$

2.  **Compute test statistic.**
    $$t^\ast = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{88.1583 - 89.5}{2.9203 / \sqrt{12}} = -1.5915$$

3.  **Find the p-value.**\
    With $df = 11$, the p-value (from the $t$-distribution table) is
    between 0.05 and 0.10.

4.  **Conclusion.**\
    Since the p-value $> 0.05$, we **fail to reject** $H_0$.\
    There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the average price
    of 2-star motels has decreased this year.

**b) Critical values and p-value bounds:**

From the $t$-distribution table for $df = 14$:

- $t = 1.761$ corresponds to a two-tailed probability of 0.10

- $t = 2.145$ corresponds to a two-tailed probability of 0.05

Since $t^* = 2.12$ falls between these values, the two-sided p-value
satisfies: $$0.05 < \text{p-value} < 0.10$$

**c) Significance:**

- At the 10% level: **Yes**, since the p-value $< 0.10$

- At the 5% level: **No**, since the p-value $> 0.05$

**d) Exact two-sided p-value using R:**

```r
    # Compute exact two-sided p-value for t* = 2.12 with df = 14
    2 * (1 - pt(2.12, df = 14))

    ## [1] 0.05235683
```

Thus, the exact two-sided p-value is approximately **0.0524**,
confirming the bracketing result.

### On a Population Proportion

To test $H_0 : p = p_0$, our options for the null and alternative hypotheses are:

- $H_0: p = p_0$ vs. $H_a: p > p_0$

- $H_0: p = p_0$ vs. $H_a: p < p_0$

- $H_0: p - p_0$ vs. $H_a: p \neq p_0$


We calculate the $z$-statistic:

$$z^* = \dfrac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\dfrac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}}}$$

In terms of a variable $Z$ having the standard normal distribution, the
p-value for a test of $H_0$ against:

- $H_a: p > \mu_0$ is $P(Z > z^{*})$

- $H_a: p < \mu_0$ is $P(Z < z^{*})$

- $H_a: p \neq \mu_0$ is $2P(Z > |z^{*}|)$

<!-- - The above statement serves as a hypothesis, moreover it is a Research -->
<!--   Hypothesis. -->

<!-- A hypothesis is: -->

<!-- - a statement about a population. -->

<!-- - a prediction that a parameter describing some characteristics of a -->

<!--   value or falls in a certain range of values. -->

<!-- For conducting a Significance Test: -->

<!-- - Researchers (you) use data to summarize the evidence about a -->
<!--   hypothesis. -->

<!-- - With data, you can compare the point estimates of parameters to the -->
<!--   values predicted by the hypothesis. -->

<!-- **Important Ideas about Hypothesis Testing** -->

<!-- - All the hypothesis tests boil down to the same question: "Is an -->

<!-- - We measure "how large" by putting our sample results in the context of -->
<!--   a sampling distribution model (e.g., Normal model, $t$ distribution). -->

<!-- To plan a statistical hypothesis test, specify the model you will use to -->
<!-- test the null hypothesis and the parameter of interest. -->

<!-- - All models require assumptions, so you will need to state them and -->
<!--   check any corresponding conditions. -->

<!-- - For example, if the conditions are satisfied, we can model the -->
<!--   sampling distribution of the proportion with a Normal model. -->
<!--   Otherwise, we cannot proceed with the test (we need to stop and -->

**Example of Hypothesis Testing for a Proportion**

In 1980s, it was generally believed that congenital abnormalities affect
5% of the nation's children. Some people believe that the increase in
the number of chemicals in the environment in recent years has led to an
increase in the incidence of abnormalities. A recent study examined 384
children and found that 46 of them showed signs of abnormality. Is this
strong evidence that the risk has increased?

**Step 1. Set up the null and alternative hypothesis:**

- The null hypothesis is the current belief: $H_0 : p = p_0$

In our example it would have a form: $H_0 : p = 0.05$

- The Alternative hypothesis is what the researcher(s) want to
  prove: $H_a : p > p_0$

In our example it would have a form: $H_a : p > 0.05$

This means a one-sided test.

- The goal here is to provide evidence against $H_0$ (e.g., suggest
  $H_a$).

You want to conclude $H_a$.\
Try a Proof by Contradiction: Assume $H_0$ is true ...and hope your data
contradicts it.

**Step 2. Check the Necessary Assumptions:**

- **Independence Assumption:** There is no reason to think that one
  child having genetic abnormalities would affect the probability that
  other children have them.

- **Randomization Condition:** This sample may not be random, but
  genetic abnormalities are plausibly independent. The sample is
  probably representative of all children, with regards to genetic
  abnormalities.

- **10% Condition:** The sample of 384 children is less than 10% of all
  children.

- **Success/Failure Condition:** $np = (384)(0.05) = 19.2$ and\
  $n(1 - p) = (384)(0.95) = 364.8$ are both greater than 10, so the
  sample is large enough.

**Step 3. Identify the test-statistics. Find the value of the
test-statistic:**

Since the conditions are met, assume $H_0$ is true:\
The sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ becomes **approximately Normal**.
That is, for large $n$, $\hat{p}$ has approximately the
$$N\left(p_0, \sqrt{\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}}\right)$$ distribution.

$$z^{*} = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\dfrac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}}}
= \frac{0.1198 - 0.05}{\sqrt{\dfrac{(0.05)(0.95)}{384}}}
\approx 6.28$$

Recall that $$\hat{p} = \frac{46}{384} = 0.1198.$$

The value of $z^\ast$ is approximately 6.28, meaning that the observed
proportion of children with genetic abnormalities is over 6 standard
deviations above the hypothesized proportion ($p_0 = 0.05$).

**Step 4.** Find the p-value of the test-statistic.\
The p-value = $P(Z > 6.28) \approx 0.000$ [(better to report
$p\text{-value} < 0.0001$)]{.nodecor}\
*Note:* We find the area above $Z = 6.28$ since $H_a : p > 0.05$.\
**Meaning of this p-value:**\
If 5% of children have genetic abnormalities, the chance of observing 46
children with genetic abnormalities in a random sample of 384 children
is almost 0.

**Step 5.** Give (if any) a conclusion.\
p-value is less than 0.0001, which is less than $\alpha = 0.05$; We
reject $H_0 : p = 0.05$, and conclude $H_a : p > 0.05$. Our result is
statistically significant at $\alpha = 0.05$.\
There is very strong evidence that more than 5% of children have genetic
abnormalities.

### On a Population Variance

In many practical situations, we are interested in testing whether the
variability in a population (i.e., its variance) has changed. This is
especially important in quality control, finance, and experimental
science. When we have data from a single normal population and want to
test a claim about the population variance, we use the chi-squared
($\chi^2$) test for one variance. This method assumes that the
underlying population is normally distributed and the sample
observations are independent.

<!-- **Hypothesis Tests for One Variance** -->

<!-- - Data from a single normal population; independent observations -->

<!-- - Variance unknown -->

<!-- - Large or small sample -->

To test $H_0 : \sigma^2 = \sigma^2_0$, our options for the null and alternative hypotheses are:

- $H_0: \sigma^2 = \sigma^2_0$ vs. $H_a: \sigma^2 > \mu_0$

- $H_0: \sigma^2 = \sigma^2_0$ vs. $H_a: \sigma^2 < \mu_0$

- $H_0: \sigma^2 = \sigma^2_0$ vs. $H_a: \sigma^2 \neq \mu_0$

We calculate the $\chi^2$-statistic:

$$\chi^2_* = \frac{(n - 1)s^2}{\sigma_0^2} \sim \chi^2_{n - 1}$$

In terms of a variable $\chi^2_{n-1}$ which follows a $t$-distribution at $n-1$ degrees of freedom, the
p-value for a test of $H_0$ against:

- $H_a: \sigma^2 > \sigma_0$ is $P(\chi^2 > \chi^2_*)$

- $H_a: \sigma^2 < \sigma_0$ is $P(\chi^2 < \chi^2_*)$

- $H_a: \sigma^2 \ne \sigma_0$ is $2P(\chi^2 > |\chi^2_*|)$




<!-- **Hypothesis Test**\ -->
<!-- $$\begin{aligned} -->
<!-- H_0 &: \sigma^2 = \sigma_0^2 \\ -->
<!-- H_a &: \sigma^2 \ne \sigma_0^2 \quad \text{(or } \sigma^2 > \sigma_0^2 \text{ or } \sigma^2 < \sigma_0^2\text{)} -->
<!-- \end{aligned}$$ Assume $H_0$ is true, then: -->

<!-- $$\text{Test statistic:} \quad \chi^2_* = \frac{(n - 1)s^2}{\sigma_0^2} \sim \chi^2_{n - 1}$$ -->

<!-- ::: tcolorbox -->
<!-- **Decision rules:** -->

<!-- $H_a : \sigma^2 \ne \sigma_0^2$.\ -->
<!-- Reject $H_0$ if $\chi^2_* > \chi^2_{n-1;\alpha/2}$ or if -->
<!-- $\chi^2_* < \chi^2_{n-1;1-\alpha/2}$. -->

<!-- $H_a : \sigma^2 > \sigma_0^2$.\ -->
<!-- Reject $H_0$ if $\chi^2_* > \chi^2_{n-1;\alpha}$ or if -->
<!-- $P[\chi^2_{n-1} > \chi^2_*]$ is too small. -->

<!-- $H_a : \sigma^2 < \sigma_0^2$.\ -->
<!-- Reject $H_0$ if $\chi^2_* < \chi^2_{n-1;1-\alpha}$ or if -->
<!-- $P[\chi^2_{n-1} < \chi^2_*]$ is too small. -->


::: {.remark}
This test is not robust to departures from Normality.
:::

:::: {.example}
A company produces metal pipes of a standard length, and claims that the
standard deviation of the length is at most 1.2 cm. One of its clients
decides to test this claim by taking a sample of 25 pipes and checking
their lengths. They found that the standard deviation of the sample is
1.5 cm. Does this undermine the company's claim? Use $\alpha = 0.05$.\
*Note: Assume length is Normally distributed.*

**Solution**

$$\begin{aligned}
H_0 &: \sigma^2 \leq 1.2^2 \\
H_a &: \sigma^2 > 1.2^2
\end{aligned}$$

$$\chi^2_* = \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{(25-1) \cdot 1.5^2}{1.2^2} = 37.5$$

$$\text{P-value} = P[\chi^2_{24} > 37.5] \approx 0.0389$$

**R Code**

```r
    1 - pchisq(37.5, df = 24);
    ## [1] 0.0389818
```

**Conclusion**\
We reject $H_0 : \sigma^2 \leq 1.2^2$. We have evidence to indicate that
the variance of the length of metal pipes is more than $1.2^2$.

::: example
A manufacturer of car batteries claims that the life of his batteries is
approximately Normally distributed with a standard deviation equal to
0.9 year. If a random sample of 10 of these batteries has a standard
deviation of 1.2 years, do you think that $\sigma > 0.9$ year? Use a
0.05 level of significance.

**Step 1. State hypotheses.** $$\begin{aligned}
H_0 &: \sigma^2 = 0.81 \\
H_a &: \sigma^2 > 0.81
\end{aligned}$$

**Step 2. Compute test statistic.**\
$S^2 = 1.44$, $n = 10$, and $$\chi^2 = \frac{(9)(1.44)}{0.81} = 16$$

**Step 3. Find Rejection Region.**\
From the chi-squared table, the null hypothesis is rejected when
$\chi^2 > 16.919$, where $\nu = 9$ degrees of freedom.

```r
library(ggplot2)

# Parameters
df <- 9
alpha <- 0.05
x_crit <- qchisq(1 - alpha, df = df)

# Data
x <- seq(0, 30, length.out = 500)
y <- dchisq(x, df = df)
curve_df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)

# Rejection region (shaded)
x_fill <- seq(x_crit, 30, length.out = 200)
y_fill <- dchisq(x_fill, df = df)
fill_df <- data.frame(x = x_fill, y = y_fill)

# Plot
ggplot(curve_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(color = "#000000", size = 1.2) +  # chi-squared curve
  geom_area(data = fill_df, aes(x = x, y = y),
            fill = "#619CFF", alpha = 0.5) +  # rejection region
  geom_vline(xintercept = x_crit, color = "#619CFF", linetype = "solid", size = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = x_crit, y = -0.003, label = "16.919",
           size = 4, vjust = 1, color = "#000000") +
  annotate("text", x = x_crit + 4, y = 0.015,
           label = expression(alpha == 0.05), parse = TRUE,
           size = 5, color = "#619CFF") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 30)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  )
```




**Step 4. Conclusion.**\
The $\chi^2$ statistic is not significant at the 0.05 level. We conclude
that there is insufficient evidence to claim that $\sigma > 0.9$ year.

## Two Sample Hypothesis Tests

We now move to examining hypothesis tests on 2 independent samples.
We will use the notation

<table class="param-table">
  <tr>
    <pd class="term">$\Theta_1$</td>
    <pd class="sep"> : </pd>
    <pd class="alt">Parameter of interest from Population 1.</pd>
  </tr>
</table>

<table class="param-table">
  <tr>
    <pd class="term">$\Theta_2$</td>
    <pd class="sep"> : </pd>
    <pd class="alt">Parameter of interest from Population 2.</pd>
  </tr>
</table>

<table class="param-table">
  <tr>
    <pd class="term">$\Theta_0$</td>
    <pd class="sep"> : </pd>
    <pd class="alt">Numerical value hypothesized under the null hypothesis.</pd>
  </tr>
</table>


Hypothesis tests of interest on 2 samples are


<table class="hypothesis-table">
  <tr>
    <td class="term">$H_0: \Theta_1 - \Theta_2 = \Theta_0$</td>
    <td class="sep">vs.</td>
    <td class="alt">$H_a: \Theta_1 - \Theta_2 > \Theta_0$</td>

    <td class="sep">vs.</td>
    <td class="alt">$H_a: \Theta_1 - \Theta_2 < \Theta_0$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="term">$H_0: \Theta_1 - \Theta_2 = \Theta_0$</td>
    <td class="sep">vs.</td>
    <td class="alt">$H_a: \Theta_1 - \Theta_2 \neq \Theta_0$</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Some other potential hypothesis tests of interest on 2 samples are

<table class="hypothesis-table">
  <tr>
    <td class="term">$H_0: \displaystyle\frac{\Theta_1}{\Theta_2} = \Theta_0$</td>
    <td class="sep">vs.</td>
    <td class="alt">$H_a: \displaystyle\frac{\Theta_1}{\Theta_2} > \Theta_0$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="term">$H_0: \displaystyle\frac{\Theta_1}{\Theta_2} = \Theta_0$</td>
    <td class="sep">vs.</td>
    <td class="alt">$H_a: \displaystyle\frac{\Theta_1}{\Theta_2} < \Theta_0$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="term">$H_0: \displaystyle\frac{\Theta_1}{\Theta_2} = \Theta_0$</td>
    <td class="sep">vs.</td>
    <td class="alt">$H_a: \displaystyle\frac{\Theta_1}{\Theta_2} \neq \Theta_0$</td>
  </tr>
</table>


::: {.remark}
A very common test is to determine whether $\Theta_1 = \Theta_2$.
Therefore, testing
<table class="hypothesis-table">
  <tr>
    <td class="sep">$H_0: \Theta_1 - \Theta_2 = \Theta_0$</td>
  </tr>
</table>
is equivalent to setting $\Theta_0 = 0$ and writing the null hypothesis as
<table class="hypothesis-table">
  <tr>
    <td class="sep">$H_0: \Theta_1 = \Theta_2$</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### On a Difference of Means

In this section, our parameter of interest is $\mu_1 - \mu_2$
where $\mu_1$ is the mean from one population and 
$\mu_2$ is the mean from another population.



#### When $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are Known

To test $H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = \mu_0$, when population variances are unknown and assumed equal, 
our options for the null and alternative hypotheses are:

- $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 > \mu_0$

- $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 < \mu_0$

- $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq \mu_0$

We calculate the $z$-statistic:
$$z = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 - \mu_0}{\sqrt{\displaystyle\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}$$




#### When $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are Not Known


#### When $\sigma_1 = \sigma_2$

To test $H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = \mu_0$, when population variances are unknown and assumed equal, 
our options for the null and alternative hypotheses are:

- $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 > \mu_0$

- $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 < \mu_0$

- $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq \mu_0$

We calculate the $t$-statistic:

$$z = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 - \mu_0}{\sqrt{\displaystyle\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}} \sim t_{\min(n_1 - 1, \, n_2 - 1)}$$
where the pooled standard deviation is defined as:
$$s_p^2 = \frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}$$

In terms of a variable $T$ which follows a standard normal distribution, 
the p-value for a test of $H_0$ against:

- $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 > \mu_0$ is $P(T > z^{*})$

- $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 < \mu_0$ is $P(T < z^{*})$

- $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq \mu_0$ is $2P(T > |z^{*}|)$

Comparing Two Population Means Managerial Success Indexes for Two Groups
(With Equal Variances Assumed)

Behavioural researchers have developed an index designed to measure
managerial success. The index (measured on a 100-point scale) is based
on the manager's length of time in the organization and their level
within the term; the higher the index, the more successful the manager.
Suppose a researcher wants to compare the average index for the two
groups of managers at a large manufacturing plant. Managers in group 1
engage in **high volume of interactions** with people outside the
managers' work unit (such interaction include phone and face-to-face
meetings with customers and suppliers, outside meetings, and public
relation work). Managers in group 2 **rarely interact** with people
outside their work unit. Independent random samples of 12 and 15
managers are selected from groups 1 and 2, respectively, and success
index of each is recorded.

**Response variable:** Managerial Success Indexes (quantitative,
continuous, 0--100 scale)

**Explanatory variable:** Type of group (nominal categorical: *Group 1 =
interaction with outsiders*, *Group 2 = fewer interactions*)

**R Code**
```r
    # Importing data file into R
    success = read.csv(file = "success.csv", header = TRUE);

    # Getting names of variables
    names(success);

    # Seeing first few observations
    head(success);

    # Attaching data file
    attach(success);
```

**Checking the Assumptions and Conditions**

**Independent Group Assumption:** The success index in group 1 is
unrelated to the success index in group 2.

**Randomization Condition:** The 27 managers were randomly and
independently selected (12 for group 1, and 15 for group 2).

**Nearly Normal Condition:** The two boxplots of success indexes do not
show skewness; the two stemplots/histograms of success indexes are
unimodal, fairly symmetric and approximately bell-shaped. Q--Q plots
also suggest the normality assumption is reasonable.

**Equal Variances Assumption:** The two boxplots of success indexes
appear to have the same spread; thus, the samples appear to have come
from populations with approximately the same variance.

Since the conditions are satisfied, it is appropriate to construct a $t$
confidence interval with\
$df = 12 + 15 - 2 = 25$.\
**From the data, the following statistics were calculated:**

$$\begin{aligned}
n_1 &= 12 &\quad n_2 &= 15 \\
\bar{x}_1 &= 65.33 &\quad \bar{x}_2 &= 49.47 \\
s_1^2 &= 6.61^2 &\quad s_2^2 &= 9.33^2
\end{aligned}$$

**The pooled variance estimator is:**

$$s_p^2 = \frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2} 
= \frac{(12 - 1)(6.61^2) + (15 - 1)(9.33^2)}{12 + 15 - 2}
= 67.97$$

**The number of degrees of freedom is:**
$$\nu = n_1 + n_2 - 2 = 12 + 15 - 2 = 25$$










#### When $\sigma_1 \neq \sigma_2$

To test $H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = \mu_0$, when population variances are unknown and assumed different, 
our options for the null and alternative hypotheses are:

- $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 > \mu_0$

- $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 < \mu_0$

- $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq \mu_0$

We calculate the $t$-statistic:

$$t^* = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 - \mu_0}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}} \sim t_{\min(n_1 -1, n_2 -1)}$$

In terms of a variable $T$ which follows a standard normal distribution, 
the p-value for a test of $H_0$ against:

- $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 > \mu_0$ is $P(T > z^{*})$

- $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 < \mu_0$ is $P(T < z^{*})$

- $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq \mu_0$ is $2P(T > |z^{*}|)$

Note a more accurate approximation of the degrees of freedom is given by
$$df = \frac{\left( \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2}
{
\left( \frac{1}{n_1 - 1} \left( \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} \right)^2 \right)
+
\left( \frac{1}{n_2 - 1} \left( \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2 \right)
}$$

This approximation is accurate when both sample sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$
are 5 or larger.

"Conservationists have despaired over destruction of tropical rain
forest by logging, clearing, and burning". These words begin a report on
a statistical study of the effects of logging in Borneo. Here are data
on the number of tree species in 12 unlogged forest plots and 9 similar
plots logged 8 years earlier:

Unlogged: 22 18 22 20 15 21 13 13 19 13 19 15\
Logged : 17 4 18 14 18 15 15 10 12

Does logging significantly reduce the mean number of species in a plot
after 8 years? State the hypotheses and do a t test. Is the result
significant at the 5% level?\
**Solution:**\
1. State hypotheses. $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ vs. $H_a: \mu_1 > \mu_2$,
where $\mu_1$ is the mean number of species in unlogged plots and
$\mu_2$ is the mean number of species in plots logged 8 years earlier.

2\. Test statistic.
$$t^* \;=\;\frac{\bar x_1 - \bar x_2}{\sqrt{s_1^2/n_1 + s_2^2/n_2}}
\;=\;2.1140$$
$$(\bar x_1 = 17.5,\;\bar x_2 = 13.6666,\;s_1 = 3.5290,\;s_2 = 4.5,\;n_1 = 12,\;n_2 = 9)$$

3\. P-value. Using Table, we have $df = 8$, and
$0.025 < \text{P-value} < 0.05$.

4\. Conclusion. Since P-value $< 0.05$, we reject $H_0$. There is strong
evidence that the mean number of species in unlogged plots is greater
than that for logged plots 8 years after logging.

A company that sells educational materials reports statistical studies
to convince customers that its materials improve learning. One new

A consultant arranges for a third-grade class of 21 students to take
part in these activities for an eight-week period. A control classroom
of 23 third-graders follows the same curriculum without the activities.
At the end of the eight weeks, all students are given a Degree of

Because we hope to show that the treatment (Group 1) is better than the
control (Group 2), the hypotheses are:

$$H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2$$ $$H_a : \mu_1 > \mu_2$$

Stemplots suggest that there is a mild outlier in the control group but
no deviation from Normality serious enough to prevent us from using t
procedures. Normal Q-Q plots for both groups confirm that both are
roughly Normal. The summary statistics are:

    # Step 2. Hypothesis Test

    t.test(treatment, control, alternative="greater")
```

**Hypothesis Test (using R)**

```r
    ##
    ##  Welch Two Sample t-test
    ## 
    ## data:  treatment and control
    ## t = 2.3106, df = 37.855, p-value = 0.01305
    ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is greater than 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  2.333784      Inf
    ## sample estimates:
    ## mean of x mean of y 
    ##    51.47619 41.52174 
```

**Hypothesis Test (using table)**

```r
    round (mean(treatment) ,2);

    ##[1] 51.48

    round (sd(treatment) ,2);

    ##[1] 11.01

    round (mean(control) ,2);

    ##[1] 41.52

    round (sd(control) ,2);

    ##[1] 17.15
```

Test statistic.\
$$t^* = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}} = 2.31$$
$$\quad
(\bar{x}_1 = 51.48, \, \bar{x}_2 = 41.52, \, s_1 = 11.01, \, s_2 = 17.15,
\quad n_1 = 21 \text{ and } n_2 = 23)$$

The conservative approach uses the *t*(20) distribution. The P-value for
the one-sided test is $$\text{P-value} = P\bigl(T \geq 2.31 \bigr)$$
Comparing $t = 2.31$ with the entries in Table 5 for 20 degrees of
freedom, we see that $$0.01 < \text{P-value} < 0.025.$$

Since our P-value is "small", we reject the null hypothesis (Note that
we would reject $H_0$ at the 2.5% significance level). The data strongly
suggest that directed reading activity improves the DRP score.

The design of the DRP study is not ideal. Random assignment of students
was not possible in a school environment, so existing third-grade
classes were used. The effect of the reading programs is therefore
confounded with any other differences between the two classes. The
classes were chosen to be as similar as possible in variables such as
the social and economic status of the students. Pretesting showed that
the two classes were on the average quite similar in reading ability at
the beginning of the experiment. To avoid the effect of two different
teachers, the same teacher taught reading in both classes during the
eight-week period of the experiment. We can therefore be somewhat
confident that our two-sample procedure is detecting the effect of the
treatment and not some other difference between the classes.

**The Fold Rule**

A rule which can be used to quickly determine whether population
variances are equal or unequal using sample variances.

If $$\frac{\max(s_1, s_2)}{\min(s_1, s_2)} < \sqrt{2} 
\quad \text{then we can consider } \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$$

and

$$\frac{\max(s_1^2, s_2^2)}{\min(s_1^2, s_2^2)} < 2 
\quad \text{then we can consider } \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$$

This is quick and simple technique. 
It is only a rule and not as strong as conducting the hypothesis tests for equality of varianges

$$H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 \quad \text{vs} \quad H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$$
which was covered in Section \@ref(sec:RatioVars)

#### Assumptions












### On a Difference of Proportions

We can use hypothesis test to compare proportions from two
independent groups as well. 

To test $H_0 : p_1 - p_2 = p_0$, our options for the null and alternative hypotheses are:

- $H_0: p_1 - p_2 = p_0$ vs. $H_a: p_1 - p_2 > p_0$

- $H_0: p_1 - p_2 = p_0$ vs. $H_a: p_1 - p_2 < p_0$

- $H_0: p_1 - p_2 = p_0$ vs. $H_a: p_1 - p_2 \neq p_0$


We calculate the $z$-statistic:

$$z_* = \frac{\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2} - p_0}{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\left(\displaystyle\frac{1}{n_1}+ \frac{1}{n_2}\right)}} \sim N(0,1).$$

where

$$\hat{p} = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{n_1+n_2}$$ 

and $n_1$ and $n_2$ represent sample sizes of each group.

In terms of a variable $Z$ which follows a standard normal distribution, 
the p-value for a test of $H_0$ against:

- $H_a: p_1 - p_2 > p_0$ is $P(Z > z^{*})$

- $H_a: p_1 - p_2 < p_0$ is $P(Z < z^{*})$

- $H_a: p_1 - p_2 \neq p_0$ is $2P(Z > |z^{*}|)$


::::: example
Nicotine patches are often used to help smokers quit. Does giving
medicine to fight depression help? A randomized double-blind experiment
assigned 244 smokers who wanted to stop to receive nicotine patches and
another 245 to receive both a patch and the anti-depression drug
bupropion. Results: After a y ear, 40 subjects in the nicotine patch
group had abstained from smoking, as had 87 in the patch-plus-drug
group. How significant is the evidence that the medicine increases the
success rate? State hypotheses, calculate a test statistic, use Table 6
to give its P-value, and state y our conclusion. (Use $\alpha = 0.01$)\
Solution:

**Step 1: State Hypothesis**

$H_0: p_1 = p_2$ and $H_a: p_1 < p_2$

**Step 2: Find test statistics**

$\hat{p_1} = \frac{40}{244} = 0.1639$ and
$\hat{p_2} = \frac{87}{245} = 0.3551$. Then
$\hat{p} = \frac{40+87}{244+245} = 0.2597$.

Now,
$z_* = \frac{\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}}{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})}} = -4.82$

**Step 3: Compute p-value**

P-value $= P(Z < z_*) = P(Z < -4.82) < 0.0003$

**Step 4: Conclusion**

Since p-value $< 0.0003 < \alpha = 0.01$, we reject the null hypothesis
that $p_1 = p_2$. The data provide very strong evidence that bupropion
increases success rate.

#### Assumptions

- Independent Response Assumption: Within each group , we need
independent responses from the cases. We cannot check that for certain,
but randomization provides evidence of independence. So, we need to
check the following:

  - Randomization Condition: The data in each group should be drawn
  independently and at random from a population or generated by a
  completely randomized designed experiment.

  - The 10 % Condition: If the data are sampled without replacement, the
  sample should not exceed 10 % of the population. If samples are bigger
  than 10 % of the target population, random draws are no longer
  approximately independent.

  - Independent Groups Assumption: The two groups we are comparing must be
  independent from each other.

- Sample Size Condition Each of the groups must be big enough. As
with individual proportions, we need larger group s to estimate
proportions that are near 0% and 100%. We check the success / failure
condition for each group.

  - Success / Failure Condition: Both groups are big enough that at least
  10 successes and at least 10 failures have been observed in each group
  or will be expected in each (when testing hypothesis).


<!-- Two-sided significance tests (later we will discuss this concept) -->
<!-- are robust against violations of this condition. In this case, we can -->
<!-- conduct significance tests with smaller sample sizes. In practice, the -->
<!-- two-sided significance test works well if there are at least five -->
<!-- successes and five failures in each sample. -->










### On a Ratio of Variances {#sec:RatioVars}

Let's begin this type of hypothesis test with a case. The question is:
how do you know whether the homogeneity of variance assumption is
satisﬁed? One simple method involves just looking at two sample
variances. Logically, if two population variances are equal, then the
two sample variances should be very similar. When the two sample
variances are reasonably close, you can be reasonably conﬁdent that the
homogeneity assumption is satisﬁed and proceed with, for example,
Student t-interval. However, when one sample variance is three or four
times larger than the other, then there is reason for a concern. The
common statistical procedure for comparing population variances
$\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$ makes an inference about the ratio of
$\sigma_1^2$/$\sigma_2^2$.


To test $H_0 : \mu_d = \mu_0$, our options for the null and alternative hypotheses are:

- $H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$ vs. $H_a: \sigma_1^2 > \sigma_2^2$

- $H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$ vs. $H_a: \sigma_1^2 < \sigma_2^2$

- $H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$ vs. $H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$


We calculate the $F$-statistic:

$$F^{*} = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} \sim F_{n_1-1,n_2-1}.$$

In terms of a variable $F$ which follows an $F$-distribution with $n_1-1$ and $n_2-1$ degrees of freedom, the
p-value for a test of $H_0$ against:

- $H_a: \sigma_1^2 > \sigma_2^2$ is $P(F > F^{*})$

- $H_a: \sigma_1^2 < \sigma_2^2$ is $P(F < F^{*})$

- $H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$ is $2P(F > |F^{*}|)$

#### Assumptions

- The two samples are independent.
- The populations from which the samples are drawn are normally distributed.
- The data are measured on a continuous scale.












## Hypothesis Tests on Paired Data

When observations in sample 1 matches with an observation in sample 2.
Observations in sample 1 are, usually, highly, correlated with
observations in sample 2, these data are often called matched pairs. For
each pair (the same cases), we form: Difference = observation in sample
2 - observation in sample 1. Thus, we have one single sample of
differences scores. For example, in longitudinal studies: Pre- and
post-survey of attitudes towards statistics (Same student is measured
twice: Time 1 (pre) and Time 2 (post). We measure change in the
attitudes: Post - Pre (for each student). Often these types of studies
are called, repeated measures.\
Paired Data Condition: the data must be quantitative and paired.\
Independence Assumption:

- If the data are paired, recall the measurements are not independent since 2 measurements are taken on each unit. 
  However, since each unit is sampled independently, the differences must be independent of each other.

- The pairs should be a random sample.

- In experimental design, the order of the two treatments may be
  randomly assigned, or the treatments ma y be randomly assigned to one
  member of each pair.

- In a before-and-after study, we may believe that the observed
  differences are representative sample of a population of interest. If
  there is any doubt, we need to include a control group to be able to
  draw conclusions.

- If samples are bigger than 10 % of the target population, we need to
  acknowledge this and note in our report. When we sample from a ﬁnite
  population, we should be careful not to sample more than 10 % of that
  population. Sampling too large a fraction of the population calls the
  independence assumption into question.

Recall Section \@ref(sec:CIsOnPaired) where we covered confidence intervals on paired data, 
we introduced the table below:

::: {#smalltbl .smalltbl #direct}
| Sample Units | Measurement 1 (\(M_{1}\)) | Measurement 2 (\(M_{2}\)) | Difference (\(M_{2}-M_{1}\))    |
|:------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|            1 | \(x_{11}\)               | \(x_{12}\)               | \(x_{d1} = x_{12} - x_{11}\)      |
|            2 | \(x_{21}\)               | \(x_{22}\)               | \(x_{d2} = x_{22} - x_{21}\)      |
|            3 | \(x_{31}\)               | \(x_{32}\)               | \(x_{d3} = x_{32} - x_{31}\)      |
|   \(\vdots\) | \(\vdots\)               | \(\vdots\)               | \(\vdots\)                        |
|            n | \(x_{n1}\)               | \(x_{n2}\)               | \(x_{dn} = x_{n2} - x_{n1}\)      |
:::



From that table, we can get $\bar{x}_{d}$, which is the mean, variance and
standard deviation of the difference. We need these values to continue
our analysis.

To test $H_0 : \mu_d = \mu_0$, our options for the null and alternative hypotheses are:

- $H_0: \mu_d = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu_d > \mu_0$

- $H_0: \mu_d = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu_d < \mu_0$

- $H_0: \mu_d = \mu_0$ vs. $H_a: \mu_d \neq \mu_0$


We calculate the $t$-statistic:

$$t^* = \dfrac{\bar{x}_{d} - \mu_0}{s_{d} / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$$
In terms of a variable $T$ which follows a $t$-distribution at $n-1$ degrees of freedom, the
p-value for a test of $H_0$ against:

- $H_a: \mu > \mu_0$ is $P(T > t^{*})$

- $H_a: \mu < \mu_0$ is $P(T < t^{*})$

- $H_a: \mu \ne \mu_0$ is $2P(T > |t^{*}|)$



:::: example
In an effort to determine whether a new type of fertilizer is more
effective than the type currently in use, researchers took 12 two-acre
plots of land scattered throughout the county. Each plot was divided
into two equal-size sub plots, one of which was treated with the new
fertilizer. Wheat was planted, and the crop yields were measured.

::: center
| Plot    | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 |
|:--------|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Current | 56 | 45 | 68 | 72 | 61 | 69 | 57 | 55 | 60 | 72 | 75 | 66 |
| New     | 60 | 49 | 66 | 73 | 59 | 67 | 61 | 60 | 58 | 75 | 72 | 68 |
:::

Can we conclude at the 5% signiﬁcance level that the new fertilizer is
more eﬀective than the current one?

**Solution:**

You can verify that the mean and standard deviation of the twelve
difference measurements are $\bar{x}_{d} = new - current = 1$ and
$s_d = 3.0151$.

**Step 1: State Hypothesis**

$H_0: \mu_d = 0$ and $H_a: \mu_d>0$

**Step 2: Find test statistics**

$t^{*} = \displaystyle\frac{\bar{x}_{d} - 0}{s_d/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1}{3.0151/\sqrt{12}} = 1.1489$

**Step 3: Compute p-value**

Using t-distribution table with df $=11$, then $0.10 < p-value < 0.15$.

**Step 4: Conclusion**

Since p-value $> \alpha = 0.05$, we can't reject $H_0$. There is not
enough evidence to infer that the new fertilizer is better.

#### Assumptions

**1. Level of significance.** $\alpha = 0.05$

**2. Null and alternative hypotheses.**
$$H_0: \mu = 7.0 \text{ hr} \qquad H_a: \mu > 7.0 \text{ hr}$$

**3. Test statistic.**

From the sample: $\bar{x} \approx 7.87$ hr, $s \approx 0.96$ hr, $n = 16$.

$$t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{7.87 - 7.0}{0.96 / \sqrt{16}} \approx 3.61$$

Reference distribution: $t_{15}$ ($\sigma$ is unknown, $df = n - 1 = 15$).

**(b)** From R output: $t^* \approx 3.61$, $df = 15$, p-value $\approx 0.0013$.

**4. p-value.** $\text{p-value} = P(T_{15} > 3.61) \approx 0.0013$.

**5. Conclusion.**

Since p-value $\approx 0.0013 < \alpha = 0.05$, we **reject $H_0$**. There is sufficient evidence at the 5% level to conclude that the mean nightly sleep time for volunteers taking the supplement exceeds 7.0 hours.

**1. Level of significance.** $\alpha = 0.05$

**2. Null and alternative hypotheses.**
$$H_0: \sigma^2 = 16 \qquad H_a: \sigma^2 \ne 16$$
(where $\sigma_0^2 = 4^2 = 16$)

**3. Test statistic.**

From the sample: $s^2 \approx 38.92$ (var(study_hrs)), $n = 25$.

$$\chi^{2*} = \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma_0^2} = \frac{24 \times 38.92}{16} \approx 58.38$$

Reference distribution: $\chi^2_{24}$.

**(c)** Degrees of freedom: $df = n - 1 = 24$.

Since $s > \sigma_0$, the statistic lies in the upper tail. For $H_a: \sigma^2 \ne 16$ (two-tailed):
$$\text{p-value} = 2 \times P(\chi^2_{24} > 58.38) \approx 0.0002$$

**4. Conclusion.**

Since p-value $\approx 0.0002 < \alpha = 0.05$, we **reject $H_0$**. There is sufficient evidence at the 5% level to conclude that the variance of weekly study hours for engineering students differs from the university-wide value of $\sigma_0^2 = 16$ hr$^2$.

<div class="content">
**(a)** Each plot is divided in half so that the two measurements (treated and control) share the same soil quality, drainage, sunlight, and microclimate. Treating each plot as a matched pair removes this background variability and gives a more powerful test of the fertilizer effect.

```r
treated <- c(45.2, 38.7, 52.1, 41.5, 48.3, 36.9, 55.0, 43.8, 40.2, 47.6)

# alternative hypothesis: true mean difference is greater than 0

A quality control team suspects that Laboratory 1 produces more variable blood-glucose readings than Laboratory 2. A sample of $n_1 = 15$ readings from Lab 1 gives $s_1 = 8.4$ mg/dL; a sample of $n_2 = 12$ readings from Lab 2 gives $s_2 = 4.1$ mg/dL. Test whether Lab 1's variance is significantly greater than Lab 2's variance.

You may use the Distribution Calculator in Section 4.1.5 to find the required tail probability.

- `var.test(x, y)` computes $F = s_x^2/s_y^2$ based on the order you pass the arguments. Since Inspector A has the larger variance, passing `inspector_a` first gives $F = s_A^2/s_B^2 \geq 1$.

**3. Test statistic.**

From the data: $s_A^2 \approx 5.568$ ($n_A = 20$), $s_B^2 \approx 3.324$ ($n_B = 18$).

Since $s_A^2 > s_B^2$, place $s_A^2$ in the numerator:
$$F^* = \frac{s_A^2}{s_B^2} = \frac{5.568}{3.324} \approx 1.675$$

Reference distribution: $F_{19,\,17}$.

**4. P-value.** For $H_a: \sigma_A^2 \ne \sigma_B^2$ (two-tailed):
$$\text{p-value} = 2 \times P(F_{19,17} > 1.675) \approx 0.290$$

An engineer tests whether Machine A produces components with smaller dimensional variability than Machine B.

You may use the Distribution Calculator in Section 4.1.5 to find the required tail probability.

(a) State $H_0$ and $H_a$.
(b) Compute $F^* = s_A^2/s_B^2$ and use the symmetry property $P(F_{df_A,df_B} < c) = P(F_{df_B,df_A} > 1/c)$ to evaluate the p-value.

<div class="exercise-label">Question 40</div>
A sports scientist compares resting heart rates (bpm) of athletes from two training regimes: Regime A ($n_1 = 20$, $\bar{x}_1 = 62.4$ bpm, $s_1 = 5.8$ bpm) and Regime B ($n_2 = 18$, $\bar{x}_2 = 66.1$ bpm, $s_2 = 7.2$ bpm).

**Part 1 — F-test for equal variances**

(a) Apply the **Fold Rule**: compute $\max(s_1,s_2)\,/\,\min(s_1,s_2)$ and compare it to $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$.
(b) Formally test $H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$ vs. $H_a: \sigma_1^2 \ne \sigma_2^2$ at $\alpha = 0.10$ using an $F$-test.

**Part 2 — Two-sample t-test**

Based on your conclusion from Part 1, test $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ vs. $H_a: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$ at $\alpha = 0.05$.

(c) Compute the pooled variance $s_p^2$ and the $t$ test statistic.

**Part 1 — F-test**

**(a)** Fold Rule:
$$\frac{\max(s_1,s_2)}{\min(s_1,s_2)} = \frac{7.2}{5.8} \approx 1.241 < \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$$

The Fold Rule suggests the population variances may be approximately equal.

**(b)** $H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$ vs. $H_a: \sigma_1^2 \ne \sigma_2^2$. Place $s_2^2$ (larger) in the numerator:
$$F^* = \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} = \frac{7.2^2}{5.8^2} = \frac{51.84}{33.64} \approx 1.541, \quad df_1 = 17,\ df_2 = 19$$

$$\text{p-value} = 2 \times P(F_{17,19} > 1.541) \approx 2(0.204) = 0.408$$
<a href="foundations-of-inference.html#distribution-calculator" target="_blank" style="font-size:0.85em; color:#2c7bb6;">🔢 Distribution Calculator</a>

Since p-value $\approx 0.408 > \alpha = 0.10$, we **fail to reject $H_0$**. Equal variances are supported; proceed with the pooled $t$-test.

**Part 2 — Pooled t-test**

**(c)**
$$s_p^2 = \frac{(19)(5.8^2)+(17)(7.2^2)}{20+18-2} = \frac{(19)(33.64)+(17)(51.84)}{36} = \frac{639.16+881.28}{36} = \frac{1520.44}{36} \approx 42.235$$

$$s_p = \sqrt{42.235} \approx 6.499$$

$$t^* = \frac{62.4-66.1}{6.499\,\sqrt{1/20+1/18}} = \frac{-3.7}{6.499 \times 0.3249} = \frac{-3.7}{2.112} \approx -1.752$$

**(d)** $df = 20+18-2 = 36$.

For $H_a: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$ (two-tailed):
$$\text{p-value} = 2 \times P(t_{36} < -1.752) \approx 2(0.044) = 0.088$$
<a href="foundations-of-inference.html#distribution-calculator" target="_blank" style="font-size:0.85em; color:#2c7bb6;">🔢 Distribution Calculator</a>

Since p-value $\approx 0.088 > \alpha = 0.05$, we **fail to reject $H_0$**. There is insufficient evidence at the 5% significance level to conclude that athletes from the two training regimes have different mean resting heart rates.

An appliance repair company wants to know whether the mean time to complete a repair call exceeds the historical benchmark of $\mu_0 = 2.0$ hours. A dispatcher randomly selects $n = 8$ recent repair calls and records their completion times (hours):

- In a normal Q-Q plot, points that fall close to the reference line are consistent with normality. Points that curve away from the line at one end only (rather than both ends) indicate skewness; a single point far from the line and from the rest of the data indicates a possible outlier.

<div class="content">

**(a)** The normality assumption does **not** appear reasonable here. The points follow the reference line fairly well in the lower-to-middle range, but the two largest observations (3.8 and 6.5 hours) bend sharply upward and away from the line. This is a classic **right-skew** signature — a long right tail — rather than a single isolated outlier, since the departure builds gradually across the upper quantiles instead of jumping abruptly at just one point. The plot provides evidence of a departure from normality.

**(b)** The one-sample $t$-procedure is **questionable** here. With only $n = 8$ observations, the sample size is too small for the Central Limit Theorem to compensate for a non-normal population, so the validity of the $t$-procedure rests heavily on the normality assumption itself — and the Q-Q plot shows a clear right-skew rather than an approximately straight line. Repair-time data of this kind often follow a skewed distribution in practice (most calls are quick, but a few take much longer), which is consistent with what is seen here. Combining the small $n$ with the visible skew, a $t$-test conducted on this sample could produce a misleading p-value.

**(a)** The Workstation 1 Q-Q plot shows all seven points falling close to the reference line — the normality assumption appears reasonable, with no meaningful departure. The Workstation 2 Q-Q plot shows five points falling almost exactly on the line, but the sixth point (21.4 minutes, from the jam) sits far above and away from the rest of the cloud. This plot provides evidence of a departure from normality in the form of a clear **isolated outlier**, not a general skew or heavy-tail pattern, since removing that one point would leave a very straight-looking Q-Q plot.

**(b)** Workstation 1's plot is uniformly close to the line along its whole length, while Workstation 2's plot is close to the line for five of its six points and then breaks sharply away at the extreme upper point. The overall shapes are otherwise similar (both show tightly clustered, roughly linear points), so the difference comes down to that single value in Workstation 2.

**(c)** As it stands, a two-sample $t$-procedure is **not fully appropriate** for comparing the two workstations, because Workstation 2's single extreme outlier strongly affects both its mean and its standard deviation with only $n_2 = 6$ observations. Before proceeding, the manager should investigate the 21.4-minute observation (it has a known, documented cause — the machine jam) and consider excluding it or analyzing the data with and without it to see how much it changes the conclusion. Workstation 1's data show no such concern and could be used as-is.

<div class="content">
- Approximate linearity in a Q-Q plot — points tracking the reference line across their full range — supports the normality assumption; it does not prove it.
- Skewness shows up as asymmetric curvature across the *whole* plot, not just at one end: look at whether one tail extends further from the line than the other, and whether the middle points sit consistently on one side of the line rather than scattering randomly around it.
- A single isolated outlier looks different from skew: one point breaks sharply away from an otherwise linear set of points, rather than several points departing by gradually different amounts.
- With small samples, the $t$-procedure has little help from the Central Limit Theorem, so its validity leans heavily on the normality condition actually holding — and having "similarly shaped" samples is not, by itself, a guarantee that a small-sample $t$-procedure will behave well.

<div class="content">

**(a)** The Q-Q plot shows systematic curvature consistent with a negatively skewed distribution: the lowest observations fall below the reference line, several central observations lie above or near it, and the upper tail is comparatively compressed. Specifically, in Section A the two lowest scores, 61 and 74, sit below the reference line (61 strongly so), while 82 lies approximately on (very slightly above) the line. Moving up, 88, 90, and 91 sit above the line, before 92 sits close to it and the highest score, 94, curves back down toward the line. Taken together — a long lower tail together with a comparatively short, compressed upper tail — this is evidence of negative skew, not a random scatter around the line. Section B's plot, by contrast, tracks the reference line closely across its entire range, which is consistent with the normality assumption appearing reasonable there.

**(b)** The lower-tail departure in Section A involves more than a single value. Looking at the three lowest scores in order — 82, 74, and 61 — the gaps between them widen steadily (82 to 74 is a gap of 8 points; 74 to 61 is a gap of 13 points), with 74 and 61 both sitting below the reference line and 61 considerably more so. A single isolated outlier would instead look like one point breaking sharply away while an otherwise tightly linear set of points remained close to the line. Here, the departure builds up gradually across several scores and is reinforced by the compressed upper tail (92 and 94 curving back toward the line rather than continuing to track it). This overall shape — long lower tail, compressed upper tail — is the signature of systematic negative skew, not one unusual score.

**(c)** For Section A, the normality assumption does **not** appear reasonable: the curvature described above is a systematic pattern rather than random scatter around the line. For Section B, the normality assumption **appears reasonable**, since all seven points lie close to the reference line with no clear curvature, heavy tails, or isolated points — though with only $n_2 = 7$ observations, this is evidence supporting normality rather than proof that the population is normal.

**(d)** The instructor's plan is **questionable** as it stands. With samples this small, a two-sample $t$-procedure's approximate validity depends on each population being reasonably close to normal; simply having "similarly shaped" samples is not by itself enough to guarantee the $t$-approximation is trustworthy, because strong skewness or outliers in *either* group can distort it. Here, Section A shows evidence of clear negative skew while Section B does not — so not only is the normality condition doubtful for one group, but the two groups also differ substantially in shape from one another. With such small samples ($n_1=8$, $n_2=7$), this combination makes the standard two-sample $t$-procedure questionable, and its result should be interpreted with caution.

**(e)** With only $n_1 = 8$ and $n_2 = 7$ observations, the Central Limit Theorem cannot be relied on to average out non-normality in the sampling distribution of the difference in means — that protection only becomes strong with much larger samples. A skewed shape like the one visible in Section A therefore carries more weight here than the same-looking departure would in a sample of, say, 100 students, where the $t$-procedure would likely still perform well regardless.

**(f)** One reasonable next step would be to collect more exam scores from Section A (and ideally Section B) so that the shape of each distribution, and the reliability of the $t$-procedure, can be assessed with more confidence. Another reasonable option is a sensitivity analysis (checking whether the conclusion changes if the lowest score is set aside). A rank-based nonparametric alternative could also be considered, but it should be noted that such procedures generally test a different question — for example, equality of medians or of entire distributions — rather than directly testing equality of the population means, so its result would need to be interpreted with that distinction in mind.

A researcher studies whether a new low-sodium diet lowers LDL cholesterol (mg/dL). Eight sets of identical twins are recruited; within each pair, one twin is randomly assigned to follow the new diet for 8 weeks while the other twin (the matched control) continues their usual diet. This matched-twin design controls for genetic and household differences between pairs, so each **twin pair** — not each individual twin — is the observational unit. LDL cholesterol is measured for both twins at the end of the study:

<div class="content">

**(a)** This is a paired study because each twin pair shares genetic background and upbringing, so the diet-twin and control-twin measurements within a pair are linked rather than independent — differences between the twins are more likely attributable to the diet itself rather than to unrelated genetic or environmental variation. The observational unit is the **twin pair**, not the individual twin.

**(b)** With $d_i = \text{Diet twin}_i - \text{Control twin}_i$:

$$d_i:\quad 134-140=-6,\ \ 128-135=-7,\ \ 143-150=-7,\ \ 137-145=-8,$$
$$129-138=-9,\ \ 128-142=-14,\ \ 128-148=-20,\ \ 108-136=-28$$

So the eight differences are $-6,\ -7,\ -7,\ -8,\ -9,\ -14,\ -20,\ -28$ (mg/dL).

**(c)** The Q-Q plot displays systematic curvature consistent with negative skew: the most negative differences fall below the reference line, the central observations tend to lie above or near it, and the upper tail is comparatively short. Specifically, the two most negative differences, $-28$ and $-20$, sit below the reference line ($-28$ strongly so), while $-14$ lies approximately near the line rather than clearly below it. The middle differences ($-9$, $-8$, $-7$) sit above the line, and the two least negative differences ($-7$ and $-6$) curve back down toward the line at the top. This asymmetric shape — a long lower tail together with a short, compressed upper tail — is evidence of negative skew, though with only $n=8$ pairs this evidence should be interpreted cautiously rather than as definitive proof of the population shape.

**(d)** The lower-tail departure involves more than a single value. Looking at the three most negative differences in order — $-14$, $-20$, and $-28$ — the gaps between them widen steadily ($-14$ to $-20$ is a gap of 6; $-20$ to $-28$ is a gap of 8), with $-20$ and $-28$ both sitting below the reference line and $-28$ considerably more so. A single isolated outlier would instead look like one value breaking sharply away while an otherwise tightly linear set of points remained close to the line. Here, the departure builds up gradually across multiple pairs and is reinforced by the compressed upper tail ($-7$ and $-6$ curving back toward the line rather than continuing to track it). This combination — long lower tail, short upper tail — is the signature of systematic negative skew, not one unusual pair.

**(e)** The normality condition does **not** appear reasonable here: the systematic curvature described in (c) and (d) — long lower tail, compressed upper tail — is a structured pattern rather than random scatter around the line, though with only 8 pairs this diagnostic evidence is limited and should be interpreted cautiously.

**(f)** A paired $t$-procedure would be **questionable** in this case. With only $n = 8$ pairs, the Central Limit Theorem offers little protection against non-normality, so the procedure's validity depends heavily on the normality condition actually holding — and the Q-Q plot instead provides evidence of negative skew in the differences. Combining the small sample size with this visible departure means a paired $t$-procedure applied here may not be trustworthy.

**(g)** A paired $t$-procedure is algebraically a **one-sample** $t$-procedure carried out on the single sample of differences $d_1, \dots, d_n$, using $\bar{d}$ and $s_d$ as its inputs. The reference $t$-distribution used by that procedure requires only that this one variable, $d_i$, be approximately normal; it places no requirement on the individual shapes of the Control-twin and Diet-twin measurements. Indeed, the Control-twin and Diet-twin columns could each look reasonably normal on their own while their differences do not (or vice versa), so examining them separately would not diagnose the condition the paired procedure actually depends on.

**(h)** Given the observed skew, one reasonable option is a **paired sign test**: it tests the **median** paired difference rather than the mean paired difference and does not require the differences to follow a symmetric or normal distribution, though this also means it addresses a somewhat different question than the paired $t$-procedure does. Another reasonable option is a **sensitivity analysis**: re-examining the conclusion with the most extreme pair (pair 8, $d = -28$) set aside, to see whether it is driving the apparent skew and whether the substantive conclusion changes without it. Recruiting **additional twin pairs** would also help assess the shape of the distribution of differences with more confidence. A rank-based procedure such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is sometimes suggested in this situation, but its usual interpretation as a test about the center of the distribution relies on the differences being approximately symmetric — an assumption that is doubtful here given the observed skew — so if used, it would need to be interpreted carefully as a statement about the distribution of differences rather than as a direct substitute for a test about the mean difference.
